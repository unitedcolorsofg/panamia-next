/**
 * Set Panamia up as a host.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Panamia publishes events of its own, and connectors get staffed to them.
 * But an event is hosted by exactly one of `host_profile_id` or
 * `host_group_id` (the `events_single_host` CHECK), and until this script has
 * run there is no row for Panamia to be either of those. There was no
 * Panamia-the-organisation in the database at all — only panas, listings and
 * the clubs panas start.
 *
 * It mints a social group, not a profile. The reasoning is in the docblock on
 * `events.hostGroupId` and repeated in lib/server/official-host.ts: deleting an
 * account blocks while it hosts upcoming events and deletes its completed
 * ones, so hanging the organisation's calendar off one person's profile means
 * the day they leave is the day the calendar dies.
 *
 * WHAT DEPENDS ON IT
 *
 * `listAssignableEvents` scopes the "Panamia events" half of the connector
 * task picker to this group. Before it exists that half is empty — the admin
 * can still attach a task to a connector event, and the picker says so. After
 * it exists, published future events hosted by this group become assignable
 * and nobody else's do.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   # Report. READ ONLY — says whether Panamia exists and what it would do.
 *   npx tsx scripts/seed-official-host.ts
 *
 *   # Dry run naming the founding admin.
 *   npx tsx scripts/seed-official-host.ts --founder=jose@panamia.club
 *
 *   # Write.
 *   npx tsx scripts/seed-official-host.ts --founder=jose@panamia.club --apply
 *
 * Reads POSTGRES_URL from .env.local, or from the environment if set there.
 *
 * On PowerShell, quote a screenname selector — a bare @name is parsed as the
 * splat operator and the run dies before reaching this script:
 *   npx tsx scripts/seed-official-host.ts '--founder=@jose'
 *
 * Idempotent: re-running once the group exists reports it and changes nothing.
 *
 * FLAGS
 *   --founder=<email|@screenname>  The pana seated as the group's first admin.
 *   --apply                        Write. Without it every run is a dry run.
