# Scripts Directory

Utility scripts for development, maintenance, and data operations.

## Available Scripts

### `env-check.ts`

Environment variable management and validation:

```bash
npm run env:check     # Validate required variables are set
npm run env:workflow  # Generate GitHub Actions env snippet
npm run env:list      # List all variables with locations
npm run env:secrets   # List variables for GitHub Secrets
npm run env:vars      # List variables for GitHub Variables
```

Uses `lib/env.config.ts` as the source of truth.

### `create-signin-link.ts`

Generate magic sign-in links for testing:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/create-signin-link.ts user@example.com
```

Two measured gotchas if you `curl` the link rather than opening it:

- **The dev server binds `::1` only.** `localhost:3003` and `[::1]:3003`
  answer; `127.0.0.1:3003` is refused with `curl: (7)`. That means the usual
  virtual-host recipe `--resolve host:port:127.0.0.1` silently never reaches
  the server, and an empty response body reads exactly like a broken route.
  Use `--resolve social.localhost:3003:[::1]`. Note Postgres is the opposite —
  `127.0.0.1:5433` is correct there — so the right loopback form differs per
  service.
- **Verify always redirects to the www host**, whichever host served it,
  because `callbackURL` is relative. Signing in on `social.localhost` still
  lands you on `localhost`. The social session is created regardless; check it
  with `/api/auth/get-session` rather than by looking at the page you land on.

### `get-signin-link.ts`

Retrieve existing sign-in tokens from the database.

```bash
npx tsx scripts/get-signin-link.ts user@example.com
```

### `delete-user.ts`

Delete a user and their associated data (accounts, sessions, profile):

```bash
npx tsx scripts/delete-user.ts user@example.com
```

### `migrate-from-mongodb.ts`

One-time migration from the legacy MongoDB export to PostgreSQL, moving every
BunnyCDN image into Cloudflare R2 on the way. It reads local dump files — there
is no live MongoDB connection.

```bash
# Preview: parses, maps and reports without writing. Reads no credentials.
npx tsx scripts/migrate-from-mongodb.ts --input ./mongodump/test --dry-run

# Full migration (rows + images)
npx tsx scripts/migrate-from-mongodb.ts --input ./mongodump/test

# Rows only, leaving images on BunnyCDN for a later pass
npx tsx scripts/migrate-from-mongodb.ts --input ./mongodump/test --skip-images

# The follow-up image pass (only touches rows still on a legacy CDN)
npx tsx scripts/migrate-from-mongodb.ts --images-only

# Fill empty columns on rows that already exist, instead of skipping them
npx tsx scripts/migrate-from-mongodb.ts --input ./mongodump/test --merge
```

**Input files** — per collection, first match wins: `<name>.json` (extended-JSON
array or JSONL), `<name>.jsonl`, or `<name>.bson` (needs `npm i -D bson`).

**What gets migrated:**

- `users.json` → `users` (the app-level collection, not `nextauth_*`)
- `profiles.json` → `profiles`
- legacy `profiles.slug` → `users.screenname`, so old `/p/<slug>` URLs keep working
- a placeholder `users` row per unclaimed profile (see below)
- images (BunnyCDN → Cloudflare R2)

Sessions, accounts and newsletter signups are deliberately not migrated; the
script header explains why for each.

**The legacy review queue.** `profiles.active` gates every public listing
query, and the old directory left 37 submissions unactioned behind it — some
for over two years. That queue was worked in 2026-08, so the import approves
every pending submission except the spam in `REJECTED_ON_REVIEW`, stamping
`status.approved` only where none exists. Legacy `status.declined` timestamps
are carried across for the record but no longer decide visibility; two of them
were a misclick and a reversal. Approvals are listed under `autoApproved`.

**Screennames** are truncated on a word boundary to fit the 24-character limit,
and collisions take a `-2`, `-3` suffix, rather than being dropped — a clipped
URL beats an unreachable profile, and renaming later is a supported flow. Only
reserved words and slugs that clean up to nothing are refused, under
`screennameRejects`; every clip is listed under `screennameTruncations`.

**Placeholder users.** `screenname` lives on `users`, and `/p/[user]` resolves
by walking `users.screenname → profiles.userId`, so a profile with no account
behind it has no public URL at all — the overwhelming majority of legacy
listings. The final row phase mints one inert user per unclaimed profile:
`emailVerified` false and no `accounts` row, so there is no credential and no
way to sign in as one. When the real owner arrives, better-auth's magic-link
flow looks a user up by email before creating one, so they are signed into that
row and land already owning their listing.

Two things follow from this. `auth.ts` `claimProfileForUser()` finds nothing
left to claim for these users, so its HighLevel lookup leans on a
first-ever-session check instead. And `profiles.userId` is `ON DELETE CASCADE`,
so undoing a run means clearing `profiles.user_id` **first** — deleting the
users directly takes the listings with them. The report's `placeholders[]`
records every profile/user id pair.

**Merging.** `--merge` only ever fills columns the existing row left empty, and
`false` counts as a value so live flags are never flipped on. The one exception
is `createdAt`, where the older timestamp wins — that is the real join date.
Columns where both sides hold different values are left alone and recorded under
`merged[].conflicts` in the report.

**The report matters.** Every run writes `migration-report-<timestamp>.json`
next to the input. A failed image transfer clears the image reference rather
than leaving a pointer at a CDN being switched off, so that report is the only
surviving record of those source URLs. Keep it.

**Requirements:**

- R2 credentials for the image pass, read from `.env.local` or the shell:
  `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_BUCKET_NAME`,
  `R2_PUBLIC_URL`. `--skip-images` needs none of them.
- A Postgres URL via `--postgres`, `$POSTGRES_DIRECT_URL`, or `$POSTGRES_URL`.
  Prefer the direct (unpooled) URL: postgres.js uses prepared statements, which
  Supabase's transaction-mode pooler rejects.
- The target database must already have the Drizzle migrations applied. Note
  that `0014_lockdown_public_schema_api` expects Supabase's `anon`,
  `authenticated` and `service_role` roles to exist.

### `reset-test-db.ts`

Reset the test database by truncating all tables (for CI):

```bash
npm run db:reset
# or
npx tsx scripts/reset-test-db.ts
```

**There is no separate test database on a developer machine.** The script's own
docstring says to use it "only with a dedicated test database", and locally
that instruction cannot be followed: every worktree's `.env.local` points at
the same `127.0.0.1:5433/panamia`. Its safety check only rejects URLs
containing `prod`, `main` or `live`, so `panamia` passes it. Running this
locally truncates every table for **every** worktree and every running dev
server, not just yours. It does require `POSTGRES_URL` to be set in the
environment — it is not read from `.env.local` — which is the only thing
standing between a bare `yarn db:reset` and everyone else's data.

### `seed-dev-data.ts`

Seeds the committed base data fixture: users, profiles, `profile_owners` and
the business actor. Run it with the social seed via `db:seed`, which chains
both in the required order:

```bash
npm run db:seed
# or, base layer only
npx tsx scripts/seed-dev-data.ts
```

Run this **before** `seed-test-account.ts`, which resolves profiles by
screenname and silently skips the ones it cannot find.

The fixture is deliberately shaped so that local results mean something:

- Both branches of directory eligibility are present — an unclaimed intake
  listing (`profiles.userId` null) and a `small_business` sole trader — so the
  `featured` and `suggest` read paths can be told apart from dead code.
- Two rows must stay invisible: an unapproved submission (`active: false`) and
  an unclaimed personal profile. A read path that returns them is widened, not
  working.
- `seed_p_legacy` and `seed_biz_pending` differ only in `status.source`, so the
  OAuth auto-claim guard is observable attaching in one case and declining in
  the other. Ad-hoc local data left this column null, which
  `notBusinessListing()` passes, making the guard untestable in both directions.
- At least one business name carries a Spanish accent, because unaccented
  fixtures hide accent-sensitive matching. This is how the `suggest` typeahead
  bug was found.

Every row mirrors a production writer and names it in a comment, and the script
uses Drizzle rather than raw SQL so a schema change breaks it at `tsc` time.
It re-queries with the production predicates when it finishes and exits
non-zero if the shapes disagree — asserting ids rather than counts, since a
count cannot distinguish a guard that discriminates from one that rejects
everything.

Idempotent: re-running updates the `seed_`-prefixed rows in place.

**The local database is shared by every worktree.** All `.env.local` files
point at the same `127.0.0.1:5433/panamia`, so this seeds _the_ dev database,
not _a_ dev database. Two consequences worth knowing before you trust a local
measurement:

- Seeding while someone else is probing changes their results mid-run. Two
  sessions on this repo each recorded a measurement, disbelieved it when it
  later disagreed with itself, and assumed operator error — the database had
  changed underneath them.
- Rows you did not create are normal. Seeing unfamiliar data is not evidence
  of a bug or of a stale query.

This is why the verification block asserts specific `seed_`-prefixed ids
rather than row counts. A count is not stable in a database someone else is
writing to; an id is.

### `fetch-directory-photos.ts`

Builds the stock photo pool in `public/img/directory/` from the Pexels API.
This is a sourcing tool, not part of the app — nothing at runtime talks to
Pexels, and the pool is committed.

```bash
PEXELS_API_KEY=... npm run photos:fetch
```

`PEXELS_API_KEY` is deliberately **not** in `lib/env.config.ts`. That file
drives Cloudflare deployment config and the CI env checks; a key only ever
needed to regenerate a committed fixture does not belong in either, and adding
it would make every deploy expect a variable the running app never reads.

**Why there are food sub-themes.** Twelve of the twenty seeded businesses are
tagged Food. Keying photos on category alone stapled three near-identical
plates of food across a whole results page, so the food category is split into
food-truck, bakery, cafe, market and supper-club. Eleven categories plus five
sub-themes at three photos each is the 48-file pool.

**Compression is optional and self-healing.** `sharp` is present transitively
(`@cloudflare/vite-plugin` → `miniflare`), not declared as a dependency, so the
script loads it through a guarded dynamic import and skips compression if it
resolves to nothing rather than failing the run. With it, the pool is 4.4 MB
instead of 5.9 MB; the worst single file drops from 1120 KB to 111 KB.

Each run rewrites `credits.json` with the photographer, source URL and alt text
per file. The Pexels **API** terms require visible attribution even though the
photo licence itself does not, which is what the credit line under the
directory results is for. Do not remove it while these photos are in use.

### `seed-business-photos.ts`

Assigns pooled photos to directory listings, replacing the generated
`data:image/png;base64` gradients that were standing in for real covers.

```bash
npx tsx scripts/seed-business-photos.ts            # dry run, prints the plan
npx tsx scripts/seed-business-photos.ts --apply    # write
npx tsx scripts/seed-business-photos.ts --explain  # matcher only, no database
npm run db:photos                                  # alias for the dry run
```

**Which column is the cover.** There isn't one. `lib/server/directory.ts` reads
`coverImage` out of the `galleryImages` JSONB as `gallery1CDN`, and
`profiles.primaryImageCdn` is the **logo**. The script therefore writes
`gallery1CDN` and clears `primaryImageCdn` to null: these are stock
photographs, and the same photo rendered both as the card cover and in the 52px
logo circle beside it reads as a bug. `result-card.tsx` renders the logo
conditionally, so null degrades to a cover-only card.

**Name keywords are checked before categories, on purpose.** The seeded data is
mis-tagged — "Clave Sound" (music) and "Raiz Bodywork" (breathwork) are both
filed under Food, and a skincare market is Food,Products. Matching on category
first gives all three a photograph of dinner. Where categories are trusted, a
priority order lets a specific one beat a broad one. `--explain` runs the whole
matcher against a table of real listing names with no database connection, which
is how that behaviour is checked.

Photos live in `public/` rather than R2 because `lib/image-src.ts` refuses to
optimize any `src` that is not root-relative, and there is no `remotePatterns`
equivalent to grant an exception.

These are stand-ins. Replace them with real photography from the businesses as
it arrives, and drop the credit line when the last stock photo is gone.

### `validate-migrations.sh`

Validates Prisma migration files for naming conventions and standards:

```bash
./scripts/validate-migrations.sh          # Check all migrations
./scripts/validate-migrations.sh --staged # Check only staged migrations
```

Called automatically by pre-commit hook.

## Running Scripts

TypeScript scripts can be run with `npx tsx`:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/script-name.ts [args]
```

For shell scripts, ensure they're executable:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/script-name.sh
./scripts/script-name.sh
```

## Environment Variables

Scripts typically need access to:

- `POSTGRES_URL` or `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection
- `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_BUCKET_NAME`, `R2_PUBLIC_URL` - Cloudflare R2 access
- `PEXELS_API_KEY` - only for `fetch-directory-photos.ts`, and only when
  regenerating the committed photo pool. Not part of `lib/env.config.ts`.
- Other service-specific credentials

Load from `.env.local` or set in shell environment.

## Adding New Scripts

1. Create script in this directory
2. Use `.ts` for TypeScript, `.sh` for shell scripts
3. **Update this README** to document the new script
4. Consider adding npm script alias in `package.json`

> **Note:** The pre-commit hook will warn if scripts are modified without updating this README.
