/**
 * Unseed
 *
 * Removes every row the seed scripts wrote, and nothing else.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 *
 * scripts/seed-dev-data.ts and scripts/seed-events.ts both refuse to touch a
 * remote database unless SEED_ALLOW_REMOTE=1, and the override exists because
 * there are legitimate reasons to want fixtures somewhere that is not
 * localhost — a demo on a pre-launch deployment being the obvious one.
 *
 * Until this file, taking that override was a one-way door. The only teardown
 * in the repo was scripts/reset-test-db.ts, which TRUNCATEs every table in the
 * database. That is the correct tool for CI and a catastrophic one anywhere
 * else, and its only guard is a substring check for "prod", "main" or "live"
 * in the connection string — which a Supabase pooler URL
 * (…@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres) passes without
 * complaint. So the safe-looking option was the one that destroyed everything.
 *
 * This script is the missing half: seeding stays reversible, so demo fixtures
 * can be cleared out afterwards without taking real rows with them.
 *
 * HOW IT IDENTIFIES A SEEDED ROW
 *
 * Every id the seeders mint is prefixed `seed_` — seed_u_*, seed_p_*,
 * seed_biz_*, seed_venue_*, seed_ev_*, seed_att_*, seed_fol_*, seed_g_*,
 * seed_a_*. The match is `starts_with(id, 'seed_')` rather than
 * `id LIKE 'seed_%'` on purpose: in LIKE, `_` is a single-character wildcard,
 * so the pattern would also match a real id beginning "seedX". Nothing in the
 * database looks like that today, which is exactly why it would be a quiet
 * bug rather than a loud one.
 *
 * The one exception is actors. seed-dev-data.ts builds them through
 * createActorForProfile — the real production writer, deliberately, so the
 * fixture exercises the same code path — and that writer mints its own id
 * with no prefix. Those are matched by their profile instead.
 *
 * ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING, and it is dictated by the schema:
 *
 *   1. events        host_profile_id, host_group_id and venue_id are all
 *                    RESTRICT, so events block profiles, groups and venues.
 *                    Cascades event_attendees and event_dismissals.
 *   2. venues        operator_profile_id is RESTRICT, so venues block
 *                    profiles.
 *   3. social actors profile_id is SET NULL, not CASCADE — dropping profiles
 *                    first would leave actors behind with a null profile and
 *                    no prefix, which is to say unidentifiable. They have to
 *                    go first, while they can still be found. Cascades
 *                    social_follows, social_groups, social_group_members.
 *   4. users         cascades profiles, and profiles cascade profile_owners.
 *   5. profiles      the business rows (seed_biz_*) hang off no seeded user,
 *                    so step 4 does not reach them.
 *
 * Safe to re-run: every step is a delete by predicate, so a second run finds
 * nothing and reports zeroes.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx scripts/unseed.ts              # dry run — counts only, no writes
 *   npx tsx scripts/unseed.ts --yes        # actually delete
 *
 * Dry run is the default because the useful thing to do against an unfamiliar
 * database is to look first.

/**
 * Turn a foreign-key failure into something an operator can act on.

 * This is the expected failure, not an exotic one. Every RESTRICT in the
 * schema exists to stop a seeded row being pulled out from under something

 * When that happens the teardown SHOULD stop. The raw Postgres error says so,
 * but buries it under a stack trace, so decode it instead.
