/**
 * Builds, installs, and launches the Android app on an emulator or a connected
 * device.
 *
 * This exists instead of a plain `cap run android` for two reasons.
 *
 * The first is environment discovery. The Android toolchain is found through
 * environment variables that nothing sets for you: Gradle needs `JAVA_HOME`,
 * and `adb` is found through `ANDROID_HOME`. Android Studio sets them for its
 * own child processes and the command-line tools do not set them at all, so on
 * a fresh shell the tooling fails with an error about a missing SDK on a
 * machine where the SDK is installed and working. The documented alternative
 * was a four-line `$env:` preamble pasted into every new terminal, which is
 * exactly the kind of instruction that goes stale and gets mistyped.
 *
 * The second is that `cap run android` is broken on Windows. Capacitor invokes
 * the wrapper as the hardcoded POSIX path `'./gradlew'`, and the argument
 * masking in `@ionic/utils-subprocess` strips only `path.sep` — which is `\`
 * on Windows. The `./` therefore survives into `cross-spawn` and the build dies
 * with `'gradlew' is not recognized`. Driving Gradle and `adb` directly is a
 * few more lines than delegating, and it is the difference between a command
 * that works on every contributor's machine and one that works on some.
 *
 *   yarn mobile:run:android                     # build, install, launch
 *   yarn mobile:run:android --avd Pixel_7       # pick a specific emulator
 *   yarn mobile:run:android --no-sync           # skip the config copy
 *
 * iOS deliberately has no equivalent. `cap run ios` needs Xcode, Xcode can only
 * live in one place and puts its own tooling on `PATH`, and none of the above
 * applies to it.
