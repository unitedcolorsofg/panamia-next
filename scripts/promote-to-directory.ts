/**
 * Audit and repair directory visibility.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * A profile appears in the directory only when BOTH of these hold:
 *
 *   1. `profiles.active = true`   — the moderation state.
 *   2. `profiles.userId IS NULL`  — an unclaimed intake listing, which is a
 *      OR the owning `users.accountType`  listing by definition and carries no
 *      is 'small_business' or 'hybrid'    account type to test.
 *
 * That predicate is `DIRECTORY_ACCOUNT_TYPES`, imported below rather than
 * restated, and it gates all five read paths: lib/server/directory.ts
 * (search + browse), /api/directory/featured, /api/directory/suggest,
 * app/sitemap.ts and /api/admin/profile/action's member count.
 *
 * The trap is that `users.accountType` defaults to 'personal' and exactly ONE
 * route in the codebase ever writes anything else —
 * app/api/createExpressProfile/route.ts, behind /form/become-a-pana. An
 * account that never completed that form is invisible to the directory
 * forever, no matter how complete its profile is. Nothing surfaces this:
 * search returns `{"data":[],"total":0}` whether the table is empty or every
 * row is filtered out. As scripts/seed-dev-data.ts puts it, "empty and broken
 * look identical from the outside".
 *
 * This script makes the difference visible, and can repair it for named
 * accounts.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   # Audit. READ ONLY — explains what the directory can and cannot see.
 *   npx tsx scripts/promote-to-directory.ts
 *
 *   # Dry run for specific accounts, by email or @screenname.
 *   npx tsx scripts/promote-to-directory.ts ana@shop.com @anabakes
 *
 *   # Write.
 *   npx tsx scripts/promote-to-directory.ts ana@shop.com --apply
 *
 * Reads POSTGRES_URL from .env.local, or from the environment if set there.
 *
 * On PowerShell, quote screenname arguments — a bare @name is parsed as the
 * splat operator and the run dies before reaching this script:
 *   npx tsx scripts/promote-to-directory.ts '@anabakes'
 *
 * Flags:
 *   --apply       Write. Without it every run is a dry run.
 *   --type=hybrid Account type to set. 'small_business' (default) or 'hybrid'.
 *   --activate    Also set profiles.active = true on the named accounts.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT touch unclaimed business-intake rows. Those are
 * approved through the emailed links at /admin/profile/action, which also
 * records the decision in `status` and mails the business — bypassing it here
 * would publish a listing nobody reviewed. The audit reports them separately
 * so they are not mistaken for a missing account type.
 *
 * Idempotent: re-running changes nothing once an account is eligible.
