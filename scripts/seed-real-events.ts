/**
 * Demo events, hosted by the real listings and groups already in the database.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Read this before running it against pana.social
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * `scripts/seed-demo.ts` deliberately creates no events. Its argument is worth
 * repeating because this script is the exception to it:
 *
 *   > Nothing this script does can put an event in front of the community that
 *   > a member did not create.
 *
 * This one does exactly that. It writes events attributed to **real
 * businesses and real groups** — people who did not ask for an event and, on
 * the day, are not holding one. That is a heavier thing than inventing fake
 * panas, because it puts words in a real person's mouth on their own listing.
 *
 * It exists anyway because the discover page cannot be evaluated empty. Every
 * lane is a join against events, so with none in the table the page renders
 * its "nothing on yet" state no matter how good the ranking is, and there is
 * no way to see whether the thing works before launch.
 *
 * So the safeguards are the whole design, not a flourish on it:
 *
 * 1. **Every row is prefixed `demo_ev_`.** Nothing a human creates starts with
 *    that, so `--undo` is a prefix delete that cannot reach a real row. Same
 *    convention as seed-demo.ts's `demo_fol_` / `demo_att_`.
 * 2. **`--undo` is shipped with it, not promised later.** The durable risk is
 *    not the demo, it is these rows still being there at launch. Note that
 *    `yarn db:unseed` does *not* cover them: it matches the `seed_` prefix,
 *    and these are `demo_` for the same reason seed-demo.ts's rows are —
 *    they attach to real data rather than to a fake world, so the blunt
 *    teardown must not be able to reach them. `--undo` is the teardown.
 * 3. **Remote writes need SEED_ALLOW_REMOTE=1**, consistent with every other
 *    seeder here.
 * 4. **A pre-flight count names how many real businesses** are about to have
 *    an event attributed to them, and waits. Mentioning it in a docblock
 *    nobody reads at 1am is not consent.
 * 5. **The description says it is a sample, in plain words.** Titles stay
 *    clean because a rail full of "[TEST]" tells you nothing about whether
 *    the design works, which is the only reason to seed at all. Anyone who
 *    opens the event sees what it is immediately.
 *
 * Tags are derived from each host's own directory categories via the same
 * `categoryKeys` the directory search uses, so the subject rails on /e are
 * filled by what these businesses actually say they do, rather than by a
 * vocabulary invented here. A coffee roaster gets Food. A gallery gets Art.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx scripts/seed-real-events.ts
 *   npx tsx scripts/seed-real-events.ts --undo
 *   SEED_ALLOW_REMOTE=1 npx tsx scripts/seed-real-events.ts --yes
 *
 * Options:
 *   --undo              remove every demo_ev_ row and its RSVPs
 *   --yes               skip the confirmation pause
 *   SEED_EVENTS_HOSTS   how many hosts to use (default 16)

 *
 * `hour` is a time of day, not a duration from now. The first version of this
 * added plain offsets to Date.now(), so every sample inherited the minute the

 * implausible for a print studio and a tell that the data is generated. Real
 * events start on the hour or the half hour.
 *
 * The two `soon` entries stay relative because they are the ones keeping
