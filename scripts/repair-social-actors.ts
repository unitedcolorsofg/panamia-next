/**
 * Repair local SocialActor identity columns so profiles are findable.
 *
 * `getActorByScreenname` — the lookup behind /api/social/actors/[username],
 * the follow button, and WebFinger — matches on BOTH username and domain:
 *
 *   and(eq(a.username, screenname), eq(a.domain, socialConfig.domain))
 *
 * Two independent defects put rows outside that predicate, and the symptom of
 * each is identical: a 404 that looks exactly like "this profile has no social
 * presence", when in fact the actor exists and is merely unreachable.
 *
 * 1. Actors minted under the wrong domain. `getFederationDomain()` falls back
 *    to the hostname in NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST_URL, so a process run with a local
 *    host but pointed at a shared database writes `domain = 'localhost'` and
 *    URIs of the form `https://localhost/p/name`.
 *
 * 2. Actors left behind by a rename. `syncActorFromProfile` copies name,
 *    summary and icon, and deliberately does NOT touch username or uri —
 *    correct for a federated actor, whose URI remote servers hold as a primary
 *    key, but it means renaming a profile strands its actor under the old
 *    handle.
 *
 * A rename that never called `syncActorFromProfile` at all also leaves the
 * actor's display name quoting the old business, which is what a follower
 * would see. `name` is not identity, so it is synced for every actor here,
 * including ones whose handle must be left alone.
 *
 * `summary` is deliberately NOT synced. The seeder wrote profiles.five_words
 * (a short tagline) there, while `getProfileSummary` would write the much
 * longer descriptions.details. Both are defensible bios and neither is stale,
 * so choosing between them is a product decision rather than a repair.
 *
 * WHY REWRITING IS SAFE HERE, AND WHEN IT WOULD NOT BE
 *
 * lib/federation/domain.ts is emphatic that changing an actor's identity
 * orphans it: the fediverse sees a new account and the Move migration carries
 * followers but not posts. That hazard is real and applies to an actor that
 * has federated. It cannot apply to an actor nothing could ever reach — no
 * remote server resolves `https://localhost/`.
 *
 * Rather than reason about which rows those are, this script refuses to touch
 * any actor showing evidence of use: statuses, follows in either direction, or
 * likes. An inert actor is rewritten; an active one is reported and skipped.
 * That guard is what makes the script safe to point at production.
 *
 * Remote actors (profile_id IS NULL) are cached copies of accounts on other
 * servers and are never considered.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   POSTGRES_URL=... npx tsx scripts/repair-social-actors.ts [--apply]
 *   POSTGRES_URL=... npx tsx scripts/repair-social-actors.ts --domain pana.social --apply
 *
 * Defaults to a dry run. Pass --apply to write. Safe to run repeatedly: a
 * second run reports nothing to do.
