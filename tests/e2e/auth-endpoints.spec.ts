/**
 * Request-level coverage for the better-auth mount at /api/auth/[...all].
 *
 * The rest of the suite only asserts that the /signin page renders its provider
 * buttons, which passes whether or not the auth API answers at all. These tests
 * cover the two ways that mount has actually broken:
 *
 *   1. vinext#2158 — the catch-all handed better-auth a path better-call would
 *      not route, 404ing every endpoint while the page still rendered fine.
 *   2. better-auth 1.7 — generic-OAuth callbacks moved from
 *      /api/auth/oauth2/callback/:id to /api/auth/callback/:id.
 *
 * better-call answers an unroutable path with a bare 404 (see its
 * router.mjs processRequest), so "not 404" is the meaningful signal that an
 * endpoint is mounted, and a literal 404 is the signal that one is gone.
 *
 * None of these need a signed-in user or reach the database: with no session
 * cookie there is no session to look up, and a callback with no state parameter
 * fails validation before any query.
