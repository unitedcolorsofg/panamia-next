/**
 * Capacitor configuration — the Pana Mia app for Android and iOS.
 *
 * This app is a native shell around the deployed site rather than a second
 * implementation of it. That is a deliberate choice and not a shortcut: this
 * codebase renders on the server with RSC and runs on Cloudflare Workers, so
 * there is no static bundle to ship inside an app package. A rewrite against
 * the API would fork every page in `app/` into a second UI that has to be kept
 * in step forever, and the first thing to rot would be the surface split that
 * `lib/panaverse/surfaces.ts` exists to keep coherent.
 *
 * So the WebView loads the same deploy a browser does. A page shipped to the
 * web is shipped to both stores the moment it deploys, and there is exactly
 * one implementation of every screen.
 *
 * What the native layer is actually for is the part a browser tab cannot do:
 * a home-screen presence, a splash screen, an offline page instead of a
 * dinosaur, push notifications, and the share/camera/geolocation permissions
 * that arrive through Capacitor plugins. Those are the reasons this exists —
 * see docs/MOBILE-ROADMAP.md for the ones that are wired up and the ones that
 * are still ahead.
 *
 * Both surfaces ship inside this one app. See `allowNavigation`.

     * itself up as part of Pana Mia — but it makes this list load-bearing in
     * three separate ways:
     *
     * 1. social.pana.social is a Custom Domain on the same Worker and the
     *    surface switcher links to it absolutely whenever PANAVERSE_SUBDOMAINS
     *    is on (see originForFrom). Leaving it out is what would turn "one app
     *    with both surfaces" into an app that ejects members to their browser
     *    the first time they tap Pana Social.
     *
     * 2. The OAuth providers have to finish inside the WebView or they do not
     *    finish at all. The callback sets the session cookie, and a cookie set
     *    in Chrome Custom Tabs or SFSafariViewController is not a cookie the
     *    WebView can read — the member would complete sign-in and land back on
     *    a signed-out app. (Google refuses OAuth in embedded WebViews on top of
     *    this; that constraint is unsolved here and written up in
     *    docs/MOBILE-ROADMAP.md.)
     *
     * 3. Stripe Checkout redirects back to a success URL on this origin, so it
     *    has the same round-trip problem as OAuth: sent to the system browser,
     *    the member pays and the app never learns that they did.

       *
       * The responsive half is why this is not a plain fixed delay: a fixed
       * delay either uncovers a blank WebView on a slow connection or sits on
       * a splash screen that is already stale on a fast one.

       * The ceiling is why this is not launchAutoHide: false, which is what
       * this originally was. That made a JS hide() call the *only* way out of

       * release, a rollback. This was not theoretical. The first emulator run
       * sat on the splash indefinitely for exactly that reason, because
       * production had not shipped NativeShell yet.
       *
       * Ten seconds is deliberately generous. It is a failsafe, not a target:
       * it has to outlast a cold start on a bad connection, since uncovering a
       * blank WebView is the failure this was guarding against in the first
       * place. Anything that reaches it is already broken, and showing a
