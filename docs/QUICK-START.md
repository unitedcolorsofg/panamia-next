# Quick Start Guide

Get the Pana Mia Club development environment running on your machine.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js**: Version 20.x or higher ([Download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **Yarn**: Package manager (see setup below)
- **PostgreSQL**: Database (Supabase recommended — see below)
- **Git**: For version control

### Yarn Setup

This project uses Yarn. Enable it via Node.js corepack:

```bash
corepack enable
```

> **Note**: The CI pipeline uses `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`, so always use Yarn to install dependencies to keep `yarn.lock` in sync.

### Optional Services

These are required for specific features:

| Service                                                                      | Purpose               | Required For          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)                                                | Payment processing    | Donations             |
| [Cloudflare Email Sending](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/) | Transactional email   | Authentication emails |
| [Cloudflare R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/)                       | Object storage        | File uploads          |
| [Cloudflare Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/)       | DB connection pooling | Production only       |

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unitedcolorsofg/panamia-next.git
cd panamia-next
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

### Federation Subtree

The `external/activities.next/` directory contains a vendored copy of [activities.next](https://github.com/llun/activities.next), pinned to a specific upstream commit. The full source is committed to this repo, so no extra fetch is needed after cloning.

`yarn install` automatically configures the `activities-upstream` git remote. To pull newer upstream changes:

```bash
yarn subtree:pull
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your credentials. Key configurations:

| Variable               | Description                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `POSTGRES_URL`         | Supabase session pooler connection string                          |
| `POSTGRES_DIRECT_URL`  | Supabase direct (unpooled) connection string — for migrations only |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`   | Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`                            |
| `BETTER_AUTH_URL`      | `http://localhost:3000` for development                            |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST_URL` | `http://localhost:3000` for development                            |
| `EMAIL_SENDER_ADDRESS` | Sender email address for CF Email Sending                          |
| `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`        | Cloudflare account ID                                              |
| `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`     | R2 API token key ID (R2 → Manage R2 API Tokens)                    |
| `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | R2 API token secret                                                |
| `R2_BUCKET_NAME`       | R2 bucket name (`panamia-media`)                                   |
| `R2_PUBLIC_URL`        | Public bucket URL (enable Public Development URL in R2 dashboard)  |

See `.env.local.example` for all available options with detailed comments.

### 4. Set Up PostgreSQL (Supabase)

1. Create a free account at [Supabase](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Go to **Project Settings → Database → Connection string**
4. Copy the **Session Pooler** string (port 5432) → `POSTGRES_URL`
5. Copy the **Direct** string (port 5432, unpooled) → `POSTGRES_DIRECT_URL`

> **Important**: Do NOT use the Transaction Pooler (port 6543) — postgres.js uses prepared statements which are incompatible with transaction mode.

**Run migrations:**

```bash
npx drizzle-kit migrate
```

---

## Development

### Start Development Server

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

The dev server includes:

- Hot module replacement (HMR)
- Fast refresh for React components
- Automatic TypeScript compilation
- Error overlay with detailed stack traces

### Code Quality

```bash
# Run linter
yarn lint

# Auto-fix linting issues
yarn lint --fix
```

**Read these tools by exit code, not by matching their output.** `prettier --check` writes its findings to stderr and colours them, so the `[warn]` you see on screen is not the character sequence in the stream — it is `[`, an ANSI escape, `warn`, another escape, then `]`. A pattern anchored on the literal text `[warn]` therefore matches nothing, on every line, and reports zero problems in a tree that has them. The output is not empty, which is what makes it convincing.

When you need the list of offending files rather than a pass/fail, use `--list-different`: plain paths, one per line, on stdout.

```bash
npx prettier --list-different .   # names the files; exit 1 if any
npx prettier --check .            # pass/fail only; trust $? or $LASTEXITCODE
```

The same caution applies to any coloured CLI output you are tempted to grep.

### Git Hooks

Pre-commit hooks automatically run:

- Prettier formatting
- ESLint checks
- Emoji character check (unicode escapes in JS/TS template literals are allowed)
- Playwright test coverage warnings

Commit messages must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
feat(articles): add co-author invitation system
fix(auth): resolve OAuth callback redirect
```

See [FEATURES.md](./FEATURES.md) for available scopes.

### Line Endings

This repo pins LF through `.gitattributes`. If your worktree was created **before** that file landed, git does not re-materialize files it is not otherwise touching, so they keep their original CRLF endings while the index correctly holds LF.

Nothing looks wrong. `git status` reports a clean tree, because the committed content is already correct — the staleness exists only on disk. The symptom shows up somewhere else entirely: `prettier --check` fails on files you never touched.

Diagnose it with the one instrument that distinguishes index from working tree:

```bash
git ls-files --eol | grep 'i/lf.*w/crlf' | wc -l
```

A non-zero count means the working tree is stale. Re-materialize it from the index:

```bash
# WARNING: discards uncommitted changes. Commit or stash first.
git rm --cached -r --quiet .
git reset --hard --quiet
```

This creates no commit and changes nothing git tracks; it only rewrites the files on disk. Untracked and ignored paths, including `.husky/_`, are left alone.

Verified on a worktree carrying 1683 stale files: the count drops to 0, `HEAD` is unchanged, the tree stays clean, and repo-wide `prettier --check .` goes from failing on files throughout the repo to failing on two only.

Those two are the floor, not a leftover:

```
external/panamia-next-crm-bridge/src/jobs/contact-sync.ts
external/panamia-next-crm-bridge/wrangler.jsonc
```

Both are `i/lf w/lf` before and after, so no amount of re-materializing will clear them — they are vendored code that was never formatted. Expect a non-zero exit from a repo-wide check and do not read it as the renormalization having failed.

Each worktree is affected independently, and a worktree created after `.gitattributes` never sees this at all — which is why it is easy to miss when it does happen.

## Testing

### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

Tests run automatically on every `git push` via GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/playwright.yml`).

#### Local Prerequisites

Before running tests locally, ensure `.env.local` exists with your DB and auth secrets — `vinext dev` loads it directly (its startup banner reads `Using secrets defined in .env.local`):

```
POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://...
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=...
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

The playwright config starts the dev server automatically via `yarn dev:http` (`vinext dev --hostname 0.0.0.0`, port 3000).

#### Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
yarn test

# Run tests in UI mode (interactive)
yarn test:ui

# View test report after a run
yarn test:report
```

### Test Coverage

Current test coverage includes:

- Authentication flows
- Profile creation and editing
- Directory search
- Screenname validation
- Navigation and routing
- Events
- Mentoring/notifications

See [TESTING_CHECKLIST.md](./TESTING_CHECKLIST.md) for manual testing procedures.

## Deployment

### Cloudflare Workers

This project deploys to [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) via the Vinext build pipeline.

**Deploy (from your machine):**

```bash
yarn deploy:vinext
```

This runs `drizzle-kit migrate` then `vinext deploy` (Vite build + wrangler publish).

**Environment variables** — set in the Cloudflare dashboard:

- Workers & Pages → `<app>` → Settings → **Variables and secrets** (CF-RUNTIME)
- Workers & Pages → `<app>` → Settings → **Build → Variables and secrets** (CF-BUILD, for `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars baked at build time)

**Cloudflare Workers Builds — dashboard commands:**

| Field                                   | Command                                          | Notes                                                                             |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Build command                           | `yarn build`                                     | Compiles only — no DB side effects                                                |
| Deploy command                          | `npx drizzle-kit migrate && npx wrangler deploy` | Runs migrations against prod DB, then ships the build; only fires on prod deploys |
| Non-production branch / version command | `npx wrangler versions upload`                   | Uploads the build as a non-production Worker version; no DB migration             |

The split keeps `drizzle-kit migrate` out of the build phase so retries and preview-branch builds never mutate prod schema. Migrations happen at deploy time only.

**Database connection pooling** — configure a [Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/) binding in `wrangler.jsonc`:

```jsonc
"hyperdrive": [{ "binding": "HYPERDRIVE", "id": "<your-hyperdrive-id>" }]
```

**Object storage** — create the R2 bucket and configure CORS:

```bash
npx wrangler r2 bucket create panamia-media
npx wrangler r2 bucket create panamia-media-preview
```

Enable **Public Development URL** on `panamia-media` in the Cloudflare dashboard to get `R2_PUBLIC_URL`. Create an R2 API token (R2 → Manage R2 API Tokens, Object Read & Write) for `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. The `R2_BUCKET` binding in `wrangler.jsonc` is used automatically in Workers — credentials are only needed for presigned URL generation and local Node.js dev.

### Build Locally

```bash
# Create production build only (no deploy)
yarn build

# Start production server locally
yarn start
```
