# Community Articles

This guide explains how to create, collaborate on, and publish articles on Pana MIA.

## Overview

Community articles let you share business updates, local news, and community commentary with the Pana MIA community. Every article requires collaboration - either a co-author or a reviewer must verify your content before it can be published.

## Collaboration

Articles cannot be published without collaboration. You have two options:

### Option 1: Invite Co-Authors

Co-authors can edit your article and share credit when published.

**To invite a co-author:**

1. Save your draft first
2. Scroll to the **Collaboration** section
3. Search for a user by their screenname
4. Optionally add a personal message explaining why you're inviting them
5. The user will receive a notification

**When someone invites you:**

1. You'll see a notification (flower icon in header)
2. Click the notification to view the invitation
3. Review the article preview and personal message
4. Click **Accept** to join as co-author, or **Decline** to pass

Once accepted, you can edit the article alongside the original author.

### Option 2: Request a Review

Reviewers verify your article's accuracy without becoming co-authors.

**To request a review:**

1. Save your draft first
2. Scroll to the **Collaboration** section under **Review**
3. Search for a user by their screenname
4. They'll receive a notification to review your article

**When someone requests your review:**

1. You'll see a notification (flower icon in header)
2. Click to open the review interface
3. Read the full article
4. Complete the review checklist:
   - Facts and claims have been verified
   - Sources are credible and properly attributed
   - Meets community standards and guidelines
5. Add comments if you have feedback
6. Click **Approve Article** or **Request Revisions**

## Best Practices

### For Authors

- **Be accurate**: Verify facts before publishing
- **Add context**: Explain why your topic matters to the community
- **Use clear titles**: Help readers know what to expect
- **Tag appropriately**: Use relevant tags, not trending ones
- **Respond to feedback**: Address reviewer comments thoughtfully

### For Co-Authors

- **Review the full article**: You share responsibility for the content
- **Suggest improvements**: Don't just rubber-stamp
- **Communicate**: Discuss changes with the original author

### For Reviewers

- **Take it seriously**: Your approval means you've verified the content
- **Be constructive**: Explain what needs improvement
- **Check sources**: Don't assume claims are accurate
- **Be timely**: Authors are waiting on your response
