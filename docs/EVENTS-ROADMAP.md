# Events Roadmap

Community events on pana.social — in-person and online gatherings hosted by the
Pana MIA network.

## Design principle: Postgres-authoritative, Nostr as an outbound mirror

pana.social is the accessible front for most users. Unlike the `external/nostrlab`
reference (where Nostr is the source of truth and RSVPs are signed Nostr events),
this module **inverts** that:

- **Postgres is authoritative.** Events and RSVPs live in Postgres.
- **No Nostr key — and no account — is required to participate.** Anyone can
  RSVP with name + email, confirmed via a magic link.
- **Publishing mirrors the event OUTBOUND to Nostr** as a NIP-52 kind-31923
  time-based calendar event, signed by the relay key, exactly as Articles mirror
  to kind-30023. This is the same crosspost path:
  `lib/relay/crosspost-client.ts` → `external/nosflare/src/event-crosspost.ts`
  (registered in `relay-worker.ts` at `/internal/events/crosspost`).

So Pana events render natively in other Nostr calendar clients (Flockstr,
Coracle, …) while remaining fully usable by people who have never heard of Nostr.

**Guiding principle for what to crosspost:** Crosspost public, static artifacts.
Don't Nostr-ify private, interactive infrastructure unless it's end-to-end
encrypted. (Articles and events qualify; live, PII-bearing flows like mentoring
do not — see `panamia-next/docs/MENTORING-ROADMAP.md`.)

## v1 (this release)

### Data model (`lib/schema/index.ts`, migration `drizzle/0011_add_events.sql`)

- **`events`** — slug, title, description, cover image, host (profile), venue
  (nullable for online), start/end, timezone, status, visibility, mode
  (online/offline/hybrid), attendee cap + count, iCal UID, tags, `nostr_event_id`.
- **`event_attendees`** — one row per (event, attendee). `profile_id` is set for
  logged-in users, null for anonymous email RSVPs. `email_verified_at` gates
  counting: only verified, `going` RSVPs count toward capacity.
- Reuses the existing **`venues`** table (capacity enforced at
  `min(event.attendee_cap, venue.fire_capacity)`) and **`verification_tokens`**
  for the magic-link token.

### Flows

- **Create / edit / publish** — host-only. Publish calls `crosspostEvent`; the
  `nostr_event_id` is recorded only when the home relay (`NOSTR_HOME_RELAY`)
  accepts the kind-31923 event. Crosspost failure never blocks local publish.
- **RSVP** — logged-in users count immediately (auth already verified their
  email). Anonymous users submit name + email, the RSVP is held pending, and a
  magic link is emailed (`event.rsvp_confirm` template); it counts only after the
  link is clicked.
- **Attendee management** — host-only roster with confirmed / pending counts.
- **Calendar export** — `GET /api/events/[slug]/calendar.ics` (RFC 5545 VEVENT).

### UI (`app/e`, `components/events`)

`/e` (discovery), `/e/new` (host), `/e/[slug]` (detail + RSVP),
`/e/[slug]/edit`, `/e/[slug]/manage`, `/e/[slug]/manage/attendees`. Reachable
from the header navigation (Events). `/e/[slug]` and `/e/[slug]/edit` still
mirror nostrlab's `RsvpButtons` / `EventForm` minus the Nostr-signer; the first
two no longer do.

**`/e` ranks by reason, not recency.** Four lanes — `follow-host`, `tag-match`,
`panas-going`, `new-host` — and every card states the one that put it there.
`lib/events/lanes.ts` holds the pure half and must stay import-free;
`lib/events/discovery.ts` holds the queries and re-exports it.

**`/e/new` shows a host what earns a card a lane, while they can still change
it.** It renders the real `EventCard` in a sticky preview and recomputes the
real lanes in the browser on every keystroke, through the same `reasonsFor` that
`/e` ranks with — no debounce and no round trip. The lanes are split by who
decides them: a checklist for the three this form settles, and `panas-going`
greyed out and uncheckable, because the form cannot produce attendance.
`lib/events/host-context.ts` resolves the viewer-shaped facts once on the
server and is the only half that touches the database;
`lib/events/host-draft.ts` is pure, owns the shared types, and owns the single
draft-to-event mapping that the preview and the readout share so the two cannot
disagree. Note the direction of that dependency — the types live in the pure
module and are re-exported by the querying one, so nothing drags a Postgres
driver into the browser.

The button reads **Save as draft**, because `POST /api/events` creates a draft;
publishing is a separate step on `/e/[slug]/manage`.

## Unlisted events (Postgres-only)

The `visibility` enum is `public | unlisted`. **Unlisted** means: excluded from
the `/e` listing and never crossposted to Nostr, but still reachable by direct
link — it is **not access-controlled**. (It was briefly named `private`; renamed
in `drizzle/0013` because "private" overstated it.)

Why unlisted, not private: NIP-52 calendar events (kind 31922/31923) are
**addressable, public, world-readable events by spec** — there is no protocol
concept of a private calendar event, private RSVP, or private guest list. (The
only Nostr-native privacy primitives are general ones — NIP-44 encryption,
NIP-59 gift wrap, NIP-29 relay groups — none of which NIP-52 profiles onto
calendars; the `external/nostrlab` reference only approximates "private RSVP" by
NIP-04-encrypting the note to the organizer and keeping it off relays.) So the
only thing we can guarantee today is keeping an event **off Nostr**:

- **Publish** (`app/api/events/[slug]/publish`): a `visibility = 'unlisted'`
  event is **never crossposted**. No kind-31923 is created, `nostr_event_id`
  stays null, and the publish response reports `crosspost.status = 'unlisted'`.
- **Public → unlisted later** (`PATCH /api/events/[slug]`): if the event was
  already crossposted (`nostr_event_id` set), the PATCH **retracts** it from the
  relay via `removeRelayEvents` and clears `nostr_event_id` (fail-open; the
  response carries `retraction: 'removed' | 'failed'`).
- **Listing**: `getUpcomingEvents` already excludes non-public events from `/e`.

Caveats: the web detail page still serves a published unlisted event to anyone
with the direct URL (secret-link semantics). Retraction hard-deletes from our
home relay's storage; copies already fanned out to external mirrors
(`NOSTR_ARTICLE_CROSSPOST_LIST`) are not chased down (no NIP-09 deletion is
emitted yet), and clients may keep cached copies. Flipping back to public does
not auto-recrosspost (publish is one-shot for published events).

## Invite-only events — scoped, not yet built

Unlisted is "hidden but link-shareable". An invite-only event is
**access-controlled**: a defined audience, an attributable guest list, and no
public surface anywhere.

### Decided model

`event_visibility` gains a third value, `invite`. Invites are **pre-seeded
`event_attendees` rows** carrying a new `invited` value on `rsvp_status` — not a
separate invites table. The row already holds everything an invite needs
(`email`, `profile_id`, `name`, `email_verified_at`), and the existing
`event_attendees_event_email_unique` index makes double-invites impossible for
free.

Non-members are invited **by email**, redeemed through the magic-link flow that
already backs anonymous RSVPs: a single-use `verification` row namespaced
`event-invite:<attendeeId>`, delivered by `sendTemplateEmail`, redeemed the way
`rsvp/confirm` redeems `event-rsvp:`. Members match on `profile_id` and never
receive a token at all.

One token per invitee, not one per event. A forwarded invite admits the
forwardee **as the named invitee** — visible on the guest list, revocable on its
own. A single shared event token would be unlisted with extra steps.

`attendee_count` is delta-maintained and gated on verified `going`
(`rsvp/route.ts:153`, `rsvp/confirm/route.ts:61`), so `invited` rows do not
disturb capacity. The Nostr ingest path recomputes from a filtered count and is
likewise unaffected.

### Read paths need no changes

Every public surface filters `eq(events.visibility, 'public')` — an allow-list.
A third enum value is excluded automatically from `/e`, search
(`lib/server/search-kinds.ts`, three sites), typeahead (`lib/server/suggest.ts`),
discovery (`lib/events/discovery.ts`), directory enrichment
(`lib/server/directory-enrich.ts`), the list queries in `lib/event.ts`, and the
AS2 endpoint (`app/api/federation/events/[slug]`).

The attending query in `lib/event.ts` (~line 316) deliberately omits the
visibility clause because it is scoped to the viewer's own RSVPs. That must
stay: an invitee has to keep seeing their own invitation.

### Two deny-lists must flip, in the same commit as the enum

These are the whole risk. Both test for `unlisted` **by name**, so a third value
falls through to the public branch:

- `app/api/events/[slug]/publish/route.ts:116` —
  `const isUnlisted = event.visibility === 'unlisted'` gates crossposting. Left
  alone, an invite-only event is **published to Nostr relays as a world-readable
  kind-31923**, and NIP-09 deletion is not emitted yet, so mirror copies cannot
  be chased down. Must become `!== 'public'`.
- `app/api/events/route.ts:139` —
  `visibility: visibility === 'unlisted' ? 'unlisted' : 'public'` coerces on
  create. Left alone, an invite-only event **silently saves as public**.

### Four gates to write

`canViewEvent(event, viewerProfileId)` belongs beside `canManageEvent` in
`lib/server/event-host.ts`, which already resolves profile-vs-group hosting.

| Surface                              | Today                   | Needed                            |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `app/e/[slug]/page.tsx:67`           | gates `status` only     | host, or invitee                  |
| `app/api/events/[slug]/calendar.ics` | **no auth at all**      | auth + gate                       |
| `app/api/events/[slug]/rsvp` POST    | gates `status` only     | gate before accepting             |
| `app/api/events/[slug]/rsvp/list`    | authed, no invite check | host, or invitee if policy allows |

`calendar.ics` additionally sets `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300`.
Cloudflare caches that at the edge, so gating the handler without changing the
header to `private, no-store` leaves the leak in place.

### Email enumeration

The RSVP form must not reveal list membership. Accept every submission, send
mail only on a match, return the same response either way — the password-reset
pattern. Without it the guest list is probeable by anyone holding the link.

### Guest-list visibility

Default to **host-only**. `event_attendees` has no per-row visibility column;
`lib/event.ts` (~248) already notes that making attendance public needs "a
visibility column and a setting, not a query change". Invitees-see-each-other is
a per-event setting and a later phase, not a v1 default.

### Phase split

**v1 — hand-picked.** Everything above.

**v2 — invite all followers.** Costs more than the symmetry suggests.
`social_follows` keys on `social_actors`; events key on `profiles`, and a host
may instead be a group (`host_group_id`) with its own membership table — so
"followers" means two different joins depending on host type. A follower-scoped
event also has no stable guest list (tomorrow's follower is retroactively
invited), which changes what the attendees page is showing.

### Nostr

Stays off-relay, same as unlisted. NIP-52 calendar events are public by spec:
there is no private calendar event, private RSVP, or private guest list. NIP-59
gift wrap could later deliver a listing to specific invitee pubkeys, but NIP-52
does not profile onto it today.

### Found while scoping — a live bug, unrelated to this feature

`app/venues/[slug]/page.tsx:34` lists a venue's events filtering
`eq(events.status, 'published')` with **no visibility clause**. Unlisted events
are being listed on public venue pages today. It would leak invite-only events
too, but it is already wrong and should be fixed on its own.

## Phase 2 — inbound RSVP sync (implemented)

Changing an RSVP in a Nostr client now updates the RSVP on pana.social, using
the **same inbound pattern as NIP-56 abuse reports**: when the relay
(`external/nosflare`) ingests a kind-31925 RSVP that targets one of our own
kind-31923 listings, its Durable Object fires a detached, fail-open
`forwardRsvpToPana()` over the `env.PANAMIA` Service Binding to
`POST /api/internal/relay/rsvp`, which upserts `event_attendees`.

- **Gating** — the relay only forwards RSVPs whose `a` coordinate is
  `31923:<relayPubkey>:<slug>` (a relay-signed Pana event).
- **Identity** — the signer pubkey maps to a member via `profiles.nostr_pubkey`
  (the genuine two-way case: a member who enrolled their key updates their RSVP
  on Nostr → their existing pana RSVP row updates in place). Otherwise the
  attendee is keyed by `nostr_pubkey` with no email; the event signature is the
  verification, so it counts without a magic link.
- **Status map** — accepted→going, tentative/waitlist→maybe, declined→not_going.
- **Latest-wins** — `nostr_rsvp_at` ignores stale (out-of-order) RSVPs;
  `attendee_count` is recomputed from rows so it never drifts.
- **No loop** — pana does not publish RSVPs to Nostr (outbound RSVP mirror is
  still deferred), so ingest cannot echo. Migration `drizzle/0012`.
- **Known limitation** — external (non-member) pubkeys must have relay write
  access for their RSVP to reach us; RSVPs blocked by the membership gate never
  arrive. The primary case (enrolled members) passes the gate.

## v2 backlog (deferred — placeholder comments in code)

- **RSVP → Nostr (kind 31925) outbound.** Mirror RSVPs the other direction —
  relay-signed, or NIP-07 self-signed for enrolled users. Attendee PII is never
  published. (Inbound is done; see Phase 2 above.) Adding this needs a
  provenance guard so an outbound mirror isn't re-ingested as inbound.
- **Inbound event listings (kind 31923).** Today only RSVPs sync inbound;
  ingesting externally-authored event listings is future work.
- **NIP-09 deletion on event delete/cancel** for crossposted events (also for
  chasing down mirror copies when a public event is made unlisted).
- **Invite-only events** — scoped; see the dedicated section above.
- **Co-organizers** (`event_organizers`), **photos** (`event_photos`,
  `/e/[slug]/photos`), **organizer notes** (`event_notes`).
- **Cloudflare streaming** (`stream_status`, `cf_stream_*`) for live events.
- Richer fields deferred from pana.social: `age_restriction`, `photo_policy`,
  `dresscode`, `panamia_co_organizer`, `tos_accepted_at`.

## Verification (run on Cloudflare after deploy)

1. The hand-written `drizzle/0011_add_events.sql` + `_journal.json` entry apply
   during the deploy/migrate step.
2. Each page renders (200, content visible): `/e`, `/e/new`, `/e/[slug]`,
   `/e/[slug]/edit`, `/e/[slug]/manage/attendees`.
3. The header navigation shows **Events**, keyboard-reachable, routing to `/e`.
4. Create → edit → publish an event; publish returns a `nostrEventId` and the
   kind-31923 event is queryable on `wss://relay.pana.social` by its `d` (slug)
   tag; the detail page shows "· on Nostr".
5. Anonymous RSVP: name + email → magic link → click → attendee verified, count
   increments, capacity blocks at `min(cap, fire_capacity)`.
6. Logged-in RSVP counts immediately; withdraw decrements.
7. `GET /api/events/[slug]/calendar.ics` opens in a calendar app.
