# Peer Mentoring — Guide & Roadmap

> **PROTOTYPE STATUS**: Peer-to-peer video mentoring using WebRTC is in **prototype/experimental stage**. While functional for testing, it may not work in all network configurations (especially behind strict firewalls or symmetric NATs). TURN server configuration is planned for improved connectivity.

## Overview

The Pana Mia Club mentoring feature enables **peer-to-peer video mentoring** within the community. Every user can act as both a **mentor** and a **mentee**, facilitating knowledge sharing and professional growth.

### Key Features

- **Profile Management**: Create and customize your mentoring profile
- **Mentor Discovery**: Search and filter mentors by expertise and language
- **Session Types**: Four session types (artistic, knowledge transfer, pana planning, pana support)
- **Session Booking**: Schedule sessions with a calendar interface
- **Mentor Confirmation**: Sessions require mentor approval before scheduling
- **Notifications**: Notifications for session requests, confirmations, and cancellations
- **WebRTC Video**: Peer-to-peer video calls via Durable Object signaling
- **Real-time Chat**: Text messaging during sessions (persisted in DO SQLite)
- **Peer-to-Peer File Transfer**: Send files directly between participants via WebRTC data channels
- **Network Resilience**: Automatic reconnection on wifi/cellular network switches
- **Session History**: Track past and upcoming sessions

### Technology Stack

- **WebRTC**: Direct peer-to-peer connections for video/audio/data
- **Durable Objects + WebSocket**: Signaling server and chat persistence (replaces Pusher)
- **better-auth**: Secure authentication
- **PostgreSQL (Supabase)**: Relational database with Drizzle ORM
- **Cloudflare Workers + Hyperdrive**: Edge deployment with DB pooling
- **shadcn/ui**: Modern, accessible UI components

### Current Limitations

- **Network restrictions**: May not work behind strict firewalls or symmetric NATs
- **No TURN servers**: Relies on STUN only, limiting connectivity success rate
- **Browser compatibility**: Requires modern browsers with WebRTC support

## Philosophy & Best Practices

### MENTOR.org E-Mentoring Standards

Pana MIA's peer mentoring feature is informed by MENTOR's _E-Mentoring Supplement to the Elements of Effective Practice for Mentoring™_, which establishes evidence-based standards for technology-enabled mentoring programs.

> "E-mentoring elevates the unique intersection of mentoring and technology by providing mentees and mentors with a diverse field of programs that center availability and accessibility of platforms, eliminate geographic barriers for matches, encourage improvement of social and relationship skills, and offer specialized academic or career related support."
>
> — MENTOR: The National Mentoring Partnership

**Reference:** [E-Mentoring Supplement to the Elements of Effective Practice for Mentoring](https://www.mentoring.org/resource/e-mentoring-supplement-to-the-elements-of-effective-practice-for-mentoring/)

### Elements of Effective Practice

The _Elements of Effective Practice for Mentoring™_ outlines six core standards:

1. **Recruitment** — How mentors and mentees are attracted to the program
2. **Screening** — Ensuring safety and appropriate matching
3. **Training** — Preparing participants for effective mentoring relationships
4. **Matching & Initiating** — Connecting mentors and mentees thoughtfully
5. **Monitoring & Support** — Ongoing oversight of mentoring relationships
6. **Closure** — Ending relationships appropriately when needed

### Pana MIA's Approach

**Peer-to-Peer Model**

- Every user can be both mentor and mentee
- Expertise is distributed across the community
- Relationships are mutual and reciprocal

**Offline Mentoring Sessions**

- Support for in-person meetings alongside video calls
- Community events as mentoring opportunities
- Local connections strengthened through digital discovery

**Accessibility-First Design**

- Mobile-responsive interface
- Multiple session types for different needs
- Free options always available (panamia_planning)

**Community Safety**

- Session requests require mentor confirmation
- Notification system keeps all parties informed
- Cancellation tracking for accountability

## Video Test (PoC)

A proof-of-concept page at `/m/webrtc-test` demonstrates the WebRTC + Durable Object signaling infrastructure independently of the mentoring session scaffolding.

### Architecture

```
Browser A ──WebSocket──► Durable Object (SignalingRoom) ◄──WebSocket── Browser B
    │                        │                                    │
    │    SDP offer/answer    │    SDP offer/answer                │
    │    ICE candidates      │    ICE candidates                  │
    │    chat messages       │    chat messages (persisted)        │
    │                        │                                    │
    └────── WebRTC P2P ──────┼────── video / audio / files ───────┘
                             │
                        SQLite storage
                     (participants, chat)
                     deleted on last leave
```

**Signaling Server**: `worker/signaling-room.ts` — a Durable Object class that:

- Accepts WebSocket connections from up to 3 participants
- Relays SDP offers/answers and ICE candidates between peers
- Persists participants and chat history in SQLite
- Supports reconnection (wifi → cellular) without losing room state
- Deletes all data when the last participant sends `leave`

**Worker routing**: `worker/index.ts` routes `/ws/signaling/:roomId` to the DO. The DO class is exported for wrangler discovery and bound as `SIGNALING_ROOM` in `wrangler.jsonc` (using `new_sqlite_classes` for CF free plan compatibility).

### How to Test

1. Deploy or run locally (`yarn dev:vinext`)
2. Log in and navigate to `/m/webrtc-test`
3. Click **Join Room** (grants camera/mic)
4. Have a second logged-in user open the same page and click **Join Room**
5. Video should connect within a few seconds

All users on the page share a single hardcoded room (`pana-test-room`, max 3 participants).

### Features Demonstrated

| Feature                       | How it works                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Video/audio**               | `getUserMedia` → tracks added to `RTCPeerConnection` → peer-to-peer                                                                                           |
| **Signaling**                 | WebSocket to Durable Object relays SDP + ICE between peers                                                                                                    |
| **Chat**                      | Messages sent via WebSocket → persisted in DO SQLite → broadcast to all                                                                                       |
| **Chat history**              | On join/reconnect, server sends full chat history from SQLite                                                                                                 |
| **Reconnection**              | On WebSocket drop, client retries with exponential backoff (up to 5 attempts). Server keeps participant in SQLite so peers know they're expected back         |
| **File transfer (immediate)** | "Send Now" reads file → chunks at 16 KB → sends via `RTCDataChannel` with back-pressure handling. Receiver reassembles and offers download                    |
| **File transfer (deferred)**  | "Send After Call" queues files locally. "End Call & Send Files" stops media tracks (frees bandwidth), then drains the queue over data channels before leaving |
| **Cleanup**                   | Explicit `leave` message removes participant from SQLite. Last participant's leave deletes all chat and participant data                                      |

### Signaling Protocol

Client → Server:

```
{ type: "join", userId, userName }
{ type: "offer", sdp, target }
{ type: "answer", sdp, target }
{ type: "ice-candidate", candidate, target }
{ type: "chat", text }
{ type: "leave" }
```

Server → Client:

```
{ type: "room-state", participants: [{userId,userName}], chatHistory: [{from,fromName,text,ts}] }
{ type: "peer-joined", userId, userName, peers }
{ type: "peer-left", userId }
{ type: "offer"|"answer"|"ice-candidate", from, sdp|candidate }
{ type: "chat", from, fromName, text, ts }
{ type: "error", message }
```

### File Transfer Limits

Files are sent peer-to-peer via `RTCDataChannel` — no server-side limit. Practical constraints:

- **Per-message**: 16 KB chunks (safe cross-browser max)
- **Memory**: Both sides buffer in memory; ~100–200 MB is comfortable
- **Back-pressure**: Sender pauses when `bufferedAmount` exceeds 256 KB
- **Deferred mode**: Stops video first, giving file transfer full bandwidth

## Notification System

### Session Request Flow

```
Mentee requests session → status: 'pending'   → Mentor notified (Invite)
Mentor accepts          → status: 'scheduled'  → Mentee notified (Accept)
Mentor declines         → status: 'declined'   → Mentee notified (Reject) + reason
Either party cancels    → status: 'cancelled'  → Other party notified (Delete) + reason
```

| Event             | ActivityPub Type | Context     |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| Session requested | `Invite`         | `mentoring` |
| Session accepted  | `Accept`         | `mentoring` |
| Session declined  | `Reject`         | `mentoring` |
| Session cancelled | `Delete`         | `mentoring` |

```

### Key Infrastructure

- `wrangler.jsonc` — Durable Objects binding (`SIGNALING_ROOM` → `SignalingRoom`), migration tag `v1` with `new_sqlite_classes`
- `worker/index.ts` — Re-exports `SignalingRoom` class, routes `/ws/signaling/:roomId` to DO stub
- `worker/signaling-room.ts` — DO with SQLite tables (`participants`, `chat`), restores state on wake, cleans up on last leave

### Database Schema

The mentoring feature uses two Drizzle models (see `lib/schema/index.ts`):

- **profiles** — Extended with `mentoring` JSONB field (`MentoringInterface` in `lib/interfaces.ts`)
- **mentor_sessions** — Tracks sessions (status, scheduling, notes, cancellation)

Indexes on mentor/mentee email, userId, status, and scheduledAt for query performance.

### Troubleshooting

**Camera/mic not working**: Check browser permissions (chrome://settings/content/camera or about:preferences#privacy).

**"Connecting..." never completes**: Likely a firewall/NAT issue. TURN servers are planned. Workaround: try a different network.

**Poor video quality**: Low bandwidth. Turn off camera for audio-only. Need 5+ Mbps for comfortable video.

**WebSocket connection failed**: Ensure the worker is deployed with the `SIGNALING_ROOM` Durable Object binding. Check `wrangler.jsonc` has the `durable_objects` and `migrations` sections.
