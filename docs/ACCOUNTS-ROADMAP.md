# Accounts Roadmap

How Panamia Club distinguishes **vendor accounts** (business listings in the
directory) from **consumer accounts** (people who search the directory and
participate in Pana social), and what has to change to support both.

## Overview

The platform already has two distinct account concepts in the schema. What it
lacks is a signup path that produces the second one. Today the only self-serve
route to a usable account runs through `become-a-pana`, which publishes the
account to the vendor directory — so there is no way to be a member of Pana
social without also being listed as a business.

The fix requires **no migration and no new columns**. The discriminator already
exists, is already populated, and is already correct on every existing row.

### Design Philosophy

1. **One profile, two presentations** — consumers and vendors share a single
   `profiles` record. Social and the directory read the same identity, so
   following a vendor and following a neighbor are the same operation.
2. **Directory listing is a property, not an identity** — being a business is a
   value of `accountType`, not a different kind of account.
3. **Consumers are not second-class** — a consumer profile is approved, active,
   and followable. It is simply not a business listing.
4. **Not listed means not indexed** — anything excluded from the directory is
   also excluded from the sitemap.

## Current State

### The two tables

| Table      | Role                        | Created when                      |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `users`    | Auth identity               | Any sign-in (Better Auth)         |
| `profiles` | Directory listing / profile | Only via an explicit profile flow |

The relationship is 1:1 — `profiles.userId` is `UNIQUE`, `onDelete: 'cascade'`,
and **nullable** (migration `0022`). Nullability supports two real flows:

- **Unclaimed profiles** — an admin-imported listing that predates its account.
  `claimProfileForUser()` in `auth.ts` attaches it on first sign-in by matching
  `profiles.email` against the user's email.
- **Tombstoned profiles** — account deletion nulls `user_id` to sever the
  cascade so the record survives for attribution.

Postgres treats `NULL`s as distinct, so many such rows coexist under the unique
constraint.

### Signing up does not create a profile

`auth.ts` contains no `insert(profiles)` anywhere. It only ever _claims_ a
pre-existing row. Profiles are created by:

| Path                               | Sets                    | Notes                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `POST /api/createExpressProfile`   | `active: true`          | `become-a-pana`; needs session |
| `POST /api/profile/importProfiles` | `active: true`          | Admin bulk import              |
| `scripts/migrate-from-mongodb.ts`  | `active` per legacy doc | One-time migration             |

**A plain sign-up therefore yields a user with no profile.**

### What `active` actually means

`profiles.active` (default `false`) is the **moderation state**, not a
visibility preference. It is written by:

| Location                         | Write           | Meaning           |
| -------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| `app/api/admin/profile/action`   | `active: true`  | Approved by admin |
| `app/api/admin/profile/action`   | `active: false` | Declined by admin |
| `lib/server/delete-account.ts`   | `active: false` | Account deleted   |
| `app/api/profile/sendSubmission` | reads `false`   | Awaiting review   |

Because `active: false` already means _declined, deleted, or pending_, it cannot
be reused to mean "this account is a consumer". Doing so would make consumers
indistinguishable from rejected vendors, pollute the admin review queue, and
make the deletion path ambiguous.

### Reading the profile is what gates social

Every social capability funnels through one check in `lib/federation/gates.ts`:

```ts
export function canCreateSocialActor(profile: Profile | null): GateResult {
  if (!profile) return { allowed: false, reason: 'no_profile' };
  if (!profile.socialEligible)
    return {
      allowed: false,
      reason: profile.socialIneligibleReason ?? 'not_eligible',
    };
  return { allowed: true };
}
```

`canPost`, `canFollow`, `canBeFollowed`, and `canFederate` all delegate to it.
The coupling is structural as well as procedural: `social_actors.profileId` is a
`UNIQUE` foreign key to **`profiles`**, not to `users`.

Two consequences worth stating plainly:

- **No profile means no social at all.** Not a degraded timeline — no actor.
- **None of the gates read `active`.** Directory visibility and social
  eligibility are already decoupled at the permission layer. `socialEligible`
  defaults to `true`.

### `accountType` exists and is inert

```ts
export const accountType = pgEnum('account_type', [
  'personal',
  'small_business',
  'hybrid',
  'other',
]);
// users.accountType — .notNull().default('personal')
```

The column is selected and echoed by `/api/user/me`, `/api/user/get`,
`/api/getUserList`, `/api/getSessionUser`, `/api/saveSessionUser`,
`/api/affiliate/acceptTOS`, and `lib/user.ts`. **Nothing branches on it.**

The rebuild notes at the top of `app/form/become-a-pana/page.tsx` already
specify the intended branching — personal profiles collect neighborhoods and
must not store a street address; `small_business` and `hybrid` collect the full
address — with a stated rationale: name plus address is a notifiable
combination under FIPA.

Because the default is `'personal'`, **every account that has ever signed up
without completing `become-a-pana` is already tagged correctly.**

---

## The Gap

A consumer who wants to use Pana social must have a profile. The only
self-serve way to get one is `become-a-pana`, which hardcodes `active: true`
("Self-created profiles are active immediately"). So joining social means
publishing yourself to the vendor directory.

The distinction was designed. It was never wired up.

---

## Proposed Model

Keep one profile per user. Let `accountType` decide directory listing. Leave
`active` meaning exactly what it means today, for both account types.

| Concern             | Field                      | Applies to          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Approved and live   | `profiles.active`          | Consumers + vendors |
| Listed in directory | `users.accountType`        | Vendors only        |
| Social enabled      | `profiles.socialEligible`  | Consumers + vendors |
| Billing tier        | `profiles.membershipLevel` | Orthogonal          |

A **consumer account** is then: a `users` row with `accountType: 'personal'`
and a `profiles` row that is `active: true`, `socialEligible: true`, carries no
street address, is reachable at `/p/[screenname]`, and is absent from both the
directory and the sitemap.

A **vendor account** is the same record with `accountType` set to
`small_business` or `hybrid` and the address fields populated.

---

## Decisions

### 1. Consumers bypass the admin approval queue

Consumer profiles are created `active: true` without review. There is nothing
to vet — no listing, no address, no business claim — and gating signup behind a
moderation queue would block social onboarding entirely.

Abuse is handled by `profiles.socialEligible` + `socialIneligibleReason`, which
suspends social participation without touching listing state. This is the
correct separation: `active` answers "is this listing approved", `socialEligible`
answers "may this account participate". Consumers only ever engage the second.

Consequence: changes #8 and #9 are mandatory, not optional.

### 2. Resilience is gated by membership, not by account type

The relay membership check is
`profiles WHERE nostrPubkey = hex AND active = true AND membershipLevel != 'free'`
— a paid-membership gate. The module's stated value proposition addresses "a
non-technical member" and sells personal identity, key backup, and social
presence. That is a consumer proposition, not a vendor one.

Consumers therefore get Resilience when they hold a paid membership, on exactly
the same terms as vendors.

This resolves a pre-existing inconsistency. Two gates disagree today:

| Gate                        | Consumer | Requires                            |
| --------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `getProfileReadiness()`     | `/r` UI  | become-a-pana complete + screenname |
| `/api/internal/relay/check` | nosflare | `active` + `membershipLevel`        |

The UI is stricter than the service it fronts, so a paying member can pass the
relay check and still be bounced by the interface. Change #5 aligns them.

### 3. Downgrading to `personal` clears the address

This is policy, not preference. The rebuild notes in
`app/form/become-a-pana/page.tsx` state that personal profiles must not store
street addresses, to limit FIPA breach exposure.

A vendor reverting to `personal` must therefore null `addressLine1`,
`addressLine2`, `addressLine3`, `addressLocality`, `addressRegion`,
`addressPostalCode`, `addressCountry`, `addressLat`, `addressLng`, and
`addressGooglePlaceId`. The profile record and its social identity survive; only
the listing data is removed.

---

## Implementation

### Where the profile is created

Signup is the wrong hook. Three constraints rule it out:

| Constraint                                                                         | Consequence                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `profiles.name` is `NOT NULL`; `users.name` is nullable                            | A magic-link signup may have no name to write   |
| `users.screenname` is nullable, assigned later via `POST /api/user/screenname/set` | A profile made at signup has no `/p/` URL       |
| `social_actors.username`/`uri`/`inboxUrl` all derive from screenname               | No screenname means no actor can be constructed |

Screenname assignment is the first moment at which all three hold. That is the
creation point. `app/api/user/screenname/set/route.ts` already loads the user's
profile in order to sync an existing actor, so this is an extension of an
existing branch rather than a new hook.

Source `profiles.name` as `users.name ?? screenname`.

### Changes

| #   | Area       | File                                       | Change                                                                                          |
| --- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Onboarding | `app/api/user/screenname/set/route.ts`     | Create a profile when none exists: `active: true`, `name: users.name ?? screenname`, no address |
| 2   | Directory  | `app/api/directory/suggest/route.ts`       | Add `inArray(users.accountType, ['small_business', 'hybrid'])`                                  |
| 3   | Directory  | `lib/server/directory.ts`                  | Same predicate on the `getSearch()` query                                                       |
| 4   | Indexing   | `app/sitemap.ts`                           | Same predicate — see _Privacy_ below                                                            |
| 5   | Readiness  | `lib/relay/profile-readiness.ts`           | Require profile + screenname only; drop `locallyBased`/`fiveWords` from the gate                |
| 6   | Onboarding | `app/form/become-a-pana/page.tsx`          | Set `accountType` on submit; branch the form per the existing rebuild notes                     |
| 7   | Onboarding | `app/api/createExpressProfile/route.ts`    | Update the caller's existing profile rather than inserting a second one                         |
| 8   | Admin      | `app/api/admin/allProfiles/route.ts`       | Same predicate — consumers must not flood the admin profile list                                |
| 9   | Admin      | `app/api/admin/profile/action/route.ts`    | Same predicate on the active-profile count                                                      |
| 10  | Downgrade  | wherever `accountType` moves to `personal` | Null every address field — see _Decisions_ §3                                                   |

Item 7 matters: once a consumer profile exists, `become-a-pana` is an **upgrade**
of that record, not an insert. The `UNIQUE` constraint on `profiles.userId`
will reject the insert otherwise.

Items 8 and 9 follow directly from the approval bypass. Both admin queries
select on `active = true` alone, and `allProfiles` returns name, email, and
phone for every match. Without the filter, every consumer signup lands in the
admin's vendor list.

### As built

The predicate lives in `lib/accounts.ts` as `DIRECTORY_ACCOUNT_TYPES`, imported
by all five read paths (#2, #3, #4, #8, #9) so the policy has one definition.
That module deliberately imports nothing, so both server queries and client
components can use it.

Three details differ from the table above:

- **Unclaimed profiles survive the filter.** `getSearch()` and `allProfiles`
  match `userId IS NULL OR accountType IN (…)`. A profile with no user is a
  legacy listing imported before accounts existed; it has no account to carry a
  type, and a bare `inArray` would have silently dropped every one of them.
  `suggest` and `sitemap` need no such clause — both already `innerJoin` users.
- **#6 sets the account type but does not branch the form.** Submitting
  `become-a-pana` now asks whether the listing is a business or a hybrid and
  writes that to `users.accountType`. The per-type field branching described in
  the file's rebuild notes (address fields, neighborhood pickers) remains
  outstanding.
- **#10 has no call site.** Nothing in the product writes `personal` back onto
  an account, so there is no downgrade to guard yet. The policy is encoded as
  `ADDRESS_FIELDS_CLEARED_ON_DOWNGRADE` / `clearedAddressPatch()` in
  `lib/accounts.ts`, ready for whoever builds that path.

`scripts/backfill-profiles.ts` closes the _Existing profile-less users_ gap
below. It defaults to a dry run; pass `--apply` to write.

### Explicitly unchanged

- **`lib/federation/gates.ts`** — no edits. Consumers get a profile, so they
  pass. `socialEligible` already defaults to `true`.
- **`app/api/user/search/route.ts`** — this is _not_ public people-search. It is
  the session-gated co-author/reviewer invite picker used by
  `components/UserSearch.tsx`. Filtering personal accounts out of it would block
  inviting a Pana as an article co-author.
- **Schema / migrations** — nothing. `accountType` already exists and is
  already populated.

---

## Privacy

`app/sitemap.ts` currently submits every profile matching
`active = true AND screenname IS NOT NULL` to search engines as
`/p/{screenname}`.

Creating consumer profiles without applying change #4 would publish every
member of the platform to Google. Changes #1 and #4 must ship together.

The decision of record is that personal profiles are reachable by direct link
and through social activity only — not discoverable by search, on-site or off.

---

## Known Gaps

- **`other` is unspecified.** The enum's fourth value has no defined directory
  behaviour. Under the predicate above it is not listed, which is a sensible
  default but has never been decided. Nothing currently writes it.
- **Existing profile-less users.** Accounts that signed up before this change
  have no profile and therefore no social access. Because creation hangs off
  screenname assignment, anyone who _already_ has a screenname will never pass
  through that route again. `scripts/backfill-profiles.ts` handles this — it
  left-joins rather than using `NOT IN`, since `profiles.userId` is nullable and
  `NOT IN` against a column containing NULLs matches nothing at all. Run it once
  after deploy.
- **Name quality.** `users.name ?? screenname` guarantees a non-null
  `profiles.name`, but a screenname-derived display name is a poor default. The
  screenname prompt should ideally collect a display name at the same time.
- **Form branching.** `become-a-pana` now records the account type but still
  shows every field to every type. The rebuild notes at the top of
  `app/form/become-a-pana/page.tsx` describe the intended per-type branching.
