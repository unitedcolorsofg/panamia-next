# Directory Search — Design & Roadmap

> **STATUS**: **Phases 1 and 2 are implemented** — migration `0040_profile_search_vector.sql`
> ships a stored `tsvector` and the directory term search now runs in Postgres;
> `0041_profile_name_trigram.sql` adds a trigram fallback so a typo in a business name no longer
> returns an empty directory. Phases 3–4 are still proposals.
>
> Before this, the directory search was a **substring scan in Node memory**, not a search engine:
> it could not handle word order, typos, plurals, or accents. Measured results from the live API
> are quoted throughout.

## Overview

Panas find businesses through `/directory/search`. The quality of that search is the difference
between the directory feeling like a community resource and feeling broken. Right now a pana who
types `"bohemain kitchen"`, `"kitchen bohemian"`, or `"foods"` gets **zero results** for a business
that exists and is active.

The fix is entirely inside PostgreSQL. No new service, no external index, no Algolia/Elastic bill.
The required extensions are already available on the database — they are simply not enabled.

### Goals

- Word order should not matter (`kitchen bohemian` finds **Bohemian Kitchen**)
- Plurals and word forms should match (`foods` finds **Food & Drink**)
- Typos should still find the business (`bohemain` finds **Bohemian Kitchen**)
- Accents should be optional both ways (`sazon` finds **Sazón**, and vice versa)
- Relevance ranking should keep today's product intent: name beats tagline beats description
- Stop loading every profile into Node memory on every request

### Non-Goals

- Changing any URL parameter, filter chip, sort option, or the map view
- Changing the CDN caching strategy (see [Risks](#risks--open-questions))
- Searching events, articles, or pana social posts — profiles only, for now

## How Search Worked Before Phase 1

All of it lives in `lib/server/directory.ts`. There are two hand-rolled stages and the database
does no searching at all.

### Stage 1 — Filter

`getSearch()` calls `db.query.profiles.findMany` with **no `WHERE` clause on the search term**,
pulling every active profile into Node, then loops over them doing a case-insensitive
`String.includes()` of the **entire query string** against:

| Field                  | Source               |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| `name`                 | column               |
| `fiveWords`            | `descriptions` JSONB |
| `tags`                 | `descriptions` JSONB |
| `details`              | `descriptions` JSONB |
| `background`           | `descriptions` JSONB |
| category keys + labels | `categories` JSONB   |

There is no tokenizing, no stemming, and no fuzzy matching. The query is one opaque string.

### Stage 2 — Rank

`matchScore()` returns the **first** matching rung of a fixed ladder:

| Match             | Score |
| ----------------- | ----- |
| name exact        | 100   |
| name `startsWith` | 80    |
| name `includes`   | 60    |
| `fiveWords`       | 40    |
| city              | 30    |
| category          | 25    |
| `details`         | 20    |
| no match          | 0     |

Ties preserve the query's alphabetical order. This stable tiebreak matters more than it looks:
most listings score `0`, so without it the bulk of the directory would reshuffle between requests.

The `nearest`, `recommended` and `name` sorts bypass scoring entirely.

### Scale

Because filtering happens in JS, **every search reads the whole `profiles` table**. This degrades
linearly with the size of the directory and is the main reason the endpoint is CDN-cached.

## Measured Failures

Run against the live dev API before any changes:

| Query              | Result   | Cause                                         |
| ------------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `bohemian kitchen` | ✅ 1     | exact substring                               |
| `kitchen bohemian` | ❌ **0** | query is one string — word order is mandatory |
| `bohemain`         | ❌ **0** | no fuzzy matching                             |
| `foods`            | ❌ **0** | no stemming (`food` → 1)                      |
| `sazon` vs `Sazón` | ❌       | no accent folding                             |

---

## Why It Is Like This

This is not an oversight — it is migration debt, and the file says so in its own header:

> _"Converted from MongoDB Atlas Search to PostgreSQL... Geo-based scoring and fuzzy search are
> simplified in this version."_

Pana Mia **had** real search on MongoDB Atlas and lost it moving to Postgres. The score ladder in
`matchScore()` is a hand-written stand-in for Atlas Search's relevance scoring. The good news is
that the product intent it encodes maps almost perfectly onto Postgres `setweight`, so we are
restoring lost capability rather than inventing new behaviour.

---

## Proposed Design

### Verified environment

Probed directly against the dev database:

- **PostgreSQL 16.10**
- `pg_trgm 1.6`, `unaccent 1.1`, `fuzzystrmatch 1.2`, `btree_gin 1.3` — all **available, none installed**
- Both `english` and `spanish` text-search configurations present
- 15 active profiles locally

### 1. Accent folding needs an IMMUTABLE wrapper

`unaccent()` is declared **STABLE**, not IMMUTABLE, because it depends on a dictionary file. That
means it **cannot** be used directly in a generated column or an expression index. The documented
workaround is a thin wrapper that pins the dictionary explicitly:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION pana_unaccent(text) RETURNS text
LANGUAGE sql IMMUTABLE STRICT PARALLEL SAFE AS
$$ SELECT public.unaccent('public.unaccent'::regdictionary, $1) $$;
```

This matters disproportionately for Pana Mia: the directory is full of bilingual and Spanish
business names. Without it, `Sazón` and `Sazon` are different words.

> **`public.` above is illustrative only — do not copy it into a migration.** On Supabase the
> extension conventionally lives in an `extensions` schema, and `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS`
> will not move it. Migration `0040` resolves the schema at run time instead; see its body below.

> **Caveat**: marking this IMMUTABLE is a controlled lie. If the `unaccent` dictionary is ever
> modified, dependent indexes silently go stale and must be `REINDEX`ed. This is standard practice
> and safe as long as we never edit the dictionary.

### 2. Flattening the JSONB category chaos

`categories` exists in the wild in **three vocabularies** (`food`, `Food`, `Food & Drink`) and
**two shapes** (`{food: true}` maps from the account form, plain arrays from the MongoDB import —
see `scripts/migrate-from-mongodb.ts:1257`, which passes values through verbatim).

An immutable flattener handles both shapes:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION pana_jsonb_flags(j jsonb) RETURNS text
LANGUAGE sql IMMUTABLE PARALLEL SAFE AS $$
  SELECT coalesce(CASE jsonb_typeof(j)
    WHEN 'array'  THEN (SELECT string_agg(v #>> '{}', ' ') FROM jsonb_array_elements(j) v)
    WHEN 'object' THEN (SELECT string_agg(k, ' ') FROM jsonb_each(j) e(k,val) WHERE val = 'true'::jsonb)
    ELSE '' END, '') $$;
```

> **Key finding.** I originally assumed normalising categories at rest was a _prerequisite_ for
> this work. It is not. The flattener turns the array row into `'Food & Drink Catering'`, and
> `to_tsvector` then tokenizes that into `food`, `drink`, `catering` — so all three vocabularies
> become searchable **without** touching the stored data. Normalisation is still worth doing, but
> only for exact **filter-chip** matching, and it is no longer blocking.

### 3. The search vector

A `STORED` generated column keeps the vector in lockstep with the row automatically — no triggers,
no risk of drift. Weights map directly onto the existing score ladder:

| Weight | Fields                          | Replaces ladder rungs |
| ------ | ------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **A**  | `name`                          | 100 / 80 / 60         |
| **B**  | `fiveWords`, `tags`             | 40                    |
| **C**  | `categories`, `addressLocality` | 30 / 25               |
| **D**  | `details`, `background`         | 20                    |

Each natural-language field is indexed under **both** `english` and `spanish`, concatenated with
`||`. `tags` and city names use `simple` (no stemming) since they are labels, not prose.

### 4. Typo tolerance: `word_similarity`, not `similarity`

The first prototype used the standard `%` operator and **failed** — `bohemain` returned nothing.

The reason is that `similarity()` compares the query against the **whole** column value. Listing
names are multi-word (`"Bohemian Kitchen"`), so a single-word query is diluted by the rest of the
string and falls under the threshold.

`word_similarity()` and its `<%` operator compare the query against the **best-matching word**
inside the value, which is exactly the semantics a search box needs. Switching operators fixed it.

Measured side by side (scores against `Bohemian Kitchen` and `Calle Ocho Cigars`):

| Query      | `similarity` | `word_similarity` |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| `kitchn`   | 0.26 ✗       | **0.71** ✓        |
| `cigards`  | 0.25 ✗       | **0.63** ✓        |
| `ventanta` | 0.37 ✗       | **0.75** ✓        |

`similarity` misses all three at _every_ usable threshold — not a tuning problem, a wrong-function
problem.

This is the single most important implementation detail in this document; using `%` here looks
correct, passes review, and quietly does not work.

---

## Prototype Results

Full prototype applied and rolled back against the dev database:

**Full-text arm**

| Query              | Before | After                                          |
| ------------------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `food`             | ✅ 1   | ✅ Bohemian Kitchen                            |
| `foods`            | ❌ 0   | ✅ Bohemian Kitchen (stemming)                 |
| `kitchen bohemian` | ❌ 0   | ✅ Bohemian Kitchen (word order)               |
| `catering`         | ✅ 1   | ✅ Bohemian Kitchen (via flattened categories) |

**Trigram arm** (`pg_trgm.word_similarity_threshold = 0.5`)

| Query      | Match            | Score                         |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `bohemain` | Bohemian Kitchen | 0.56                          |
| `bohemin`  | Bohemian Kitchen | 0.75                          |
| `kitchn`   | Bohemian Kitchen | 0.71                          |
| `zzzz`     | _none_           | — correctly no false positive |

## Roadmap

Each phase is independently shippable and independently revertible.

### Phase 1 — Full-text search ✅ **shipped**

Delivered by `drizzle/0040_profile_search_vector.sql` and `lib/server/directory.ts`:

- `unaccent` enabled; `pana_unaccent` and `pana_jsonb_flags` added as IMMUTABLE helpers
- `profiles.search_vector` generated column + `profiles_search_vector_idx` GIN index
- `getSearch()` resolves the term in SQL via `websearch_to_tsquery` before loading anything, and
  short-circuits to an empty result when nothing matches
- `matchScore()` and `categorySearchText()` deleted; ranking is `ts_rank_cd` plus two boosts that
  preserve the old ladder's top rungs (exact name `+1000`, name prefix `+100`)
- `search_vector` is deliberately **not** mapped in `lib/schema/index.ts`, so Drizzle never selects
  it on ordinary profile reads

The query is OR'd across `english`, `spanish` **and** `simple`. The `simple` arm is not redundant:
it is the only one that survives a query made **entirely** of stop words. Searching `the` alone
reduces the stemmed arms to an empty tsquery, so a business named _The Hall_ would be unreachable
by its own first word. This needs the whole query to be stop words — `the hall` matches fine
without the simple arm, because `hall` survives stemming. Measured against a _The Hall_ row:

| Query      | `english` only | `english ‖ simple` |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| `the hall` | 1              | 1                  |
| `the`      | **0**          | 1                  |
| `hall`     | 1              | 1                  |

**Verified against the live API** with four seeded listings covering every stored category shape
and vocabulary (removed afterwards):

| Query              | Before | After                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kitchen`          | —      | `Kitchen` › `Kitchen Sink Cafe` › `Bohemian Kitchen` — exact, then prefix, then contains |
| `kitchen bohemian` | ❌ 0   | ✅ Bohemian Kitchen                                                                      |
| `criollo sazon`    | ❌ 0   | ✅ Sazon Criollo                                                                         |
| `foods`            | ❌ 0   | ✅ Bohemian Kitchen                                                                      |
| `sazón` / `sazon`  | ❌     | ✅ both find Sazon Criollo                                                               |
| `arepas`           | ❌ 0   | ✅ Sazon Criollo (Spanish stemming, weight D)                                            |
| `zzzqqq`           | 0      | ✅ 0 — no false positives                                                                |

Term and chip agree across all three vocabularies: `q=food` and `fcat=food` each return the same
four listings, spanning `{"food":true}`, `["food"]` and `["Food & Drink"]`.

### Phase 2 — Typo tolerance ✅ **shipped** (migration `0041`)

Shipped as specified, with three details that only surfaced once it was built and measured.

**It fires only when full-text search returns _zero_ rows**, not "few" rows. That avoids inventing
a threshold for what "few" means, keeps fuzzy matches from polluting queries that already work,
and costs nothing on the happy path. Because the two result sets never mix, the planned `UNION`
with a below-exact ranking was unnecessary — there is no ranking conflict to resolve.

**The threshold is 0.5, not pg_trgm's default 0.6.** Measured against a 12-name corpus with
realistic typos:

| Query              | Intended match    | `word_similarity` |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| `bohemian kitchne` | Bohemian Kitchen  | 0.82              |
| `kitchn`           | Bohemian Kitchen  | 0.71              |
| `bohemain`         | Bohemian Kitchen  | 0.56              |
| `bisayne yoga`     | Biscayne Bay Yoga | **0.58**          |
| `restaurant`       | _(none)_          | 0.18              |
| `zzzqqq`           | _(none)_          | 0.00              |

Worst true match 0.58, best non-match 0.18 — anything in roughly 0.3–0.55 works. The default 0.6
would have silently dropped both `bisayne yoga` and `bohemain`.

**Re-measured at 20k rows, because a 12-name corpus proves nothing about a threshold.** The
concern was that the 0.18–0.58 gap is measured at its narrowest point and that false positives
would climb with volume. What actually happens is the opposite — raising to 0.6 loses real
targets entirely, so the default's risk is a silent miss:

| Query          | at 0.5    | at 0.6     |
| -------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| `bohemain`     | found     | **missed** |
| `bisayne yoga` | found     | **missed** |
| `sazon criolo` | 1st of 1  | 1st of 1   |
| `wynwod print` | 2nd of 12 | 2nd of 12  |

**Precision, not the threshold, is what degrades — and it tracks word reuse rather than table
size.** Against 20k names at 0.5:

| Query          | Target rank | Matches | Why                                     |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `sazon criolo` | 1st         | 1       | distinctive, accented                   |
| `bisayne yoga` | 2nd         | 3       | distinctive place name                  |
| `wynwod print` | 2nd         | 12      | distinctive place name                  |
| `kitchn`       | **34th**    | 375     | 375 names contain "Kitchen"; scores tie |

`word_similarity` scores by the single best-matching word, so every `<something> Kitchen` ties at
0.71 and the tiebreak is arbitrary. This is acceptable: a one-word typo of a generic noun returns
the same set the corrected spelling would, so it degrades to a broad list rather than a confident
wrong answer. Three orderings were tried — `word_similarity` alone, whole-string `similarity`
first, and shortest-name tiebreak — and none fixed it; shortest-name pushed `kitchn` from 34th to
69th while only improving cases that already ranked 1st or 2nd.

> One caveat on the synthetic corpus: it draws from 40 adjectives and 60 nouns, so **456 of its
> 20,000 names contain "Bohemian"** — about 2.3% of the directory sharing one adjective, which no
> real directory does. Treat the distinctive-word rows as representative and the `bohemain` row as
> an artifact of that reuse. The `kitchn` row is realistic: a real directory of that size genuinely
> does have hundreds of businesses with "Kitchen" in the name.

**The operator form is not optional.** `word_similarity(q, col) >= 0.5` reads identically to
`col %> q` and cannot use the GIN index. At 20k rows:

| Form                                    | Plan              | Time        |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| `pana_unaccent(name) %> 'bohemain'`     | Bitmap Index Scan | **0.09 ms** |
| `word_similarity('bohemain', …) >= 0.5` | Seq Scan          | 49.5 ms     |

The operator reads its cutoff from `pg_trgm.word_similarity_threshold`, which is why the query runs
in a transaction with `set_config(…, true)` (`SET LOCAL`) — a GUC cannot be a bind parameter in
`SET`, but it can in `set_config`. The indexed expression must be written exactly as indexed
(`pana_unaccent(name)`, left-hand side) or the index is skipped.

> **`pg_trgm` has the same schema trap as `unaccent`, in three places.** An unqualified
> `gin_trgm_ops` fails at migration time; `word_similarity()` and `%>` each fail separately at
> runtime. `0041` resolves the schema for the index and asserts the extension is in `public` or
> `extensions`, matching the `search_path` the application sets. Verified against both layouts.

### Phase 3 — Move the remaining filters into SQL _(scale)_

- Normalise `categories` / `counties` at rest to canonical `{key: true}` maps, mirroring
  `canonical()` in `lib/server/directory.ts`
- Push category, county, certified and mentoring filters into the `WHERE` clause
- Delete the load-everything `findMany`

This is the only phase that requires a data backfill, and it is now a **scale** improvement rather
than a correctness prerequisite.

### Phase 4 — Optional polish

- `pg_trgm` on `fiveWords` as well as `name`
- Search-term analytics to find queries that return zero results
- Extend the vector to events and pana social posts

## Migration `0040`

Migrations here are **hand-written**, not drizzle-generated (`npm run db:generate` deliberately
errors out and says so; the drizzle-kit snapshot is intentionally stale — see `drizzle.config.ts`).
Follow `drizzle/TEMPLATE.sql` for the header block and `drizzle/0037_profile_signals.sql` for
house style: prose rationale, `--> statement-breakpoint` between statements, `IF NOT EXISTS`
everywhere, a comment above every index, and a real `Rollback:` section.

The latest migration is `0039_drop_owner_self_signals.sql`, so this became
`0040_profile_search_vector.sql` — **written and applied**. Hand-written migrations also need an
entry in `drizzle/meta/_journal.json`; `drizzle-kit migrate` ignores files that are not listed
there, so a migration without one silently never runs.

Abridged body (see the file for the full header and rationale):

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS unaccent;
--> statement-breakpoint

-- The schema unaccent lives in is resolved here, not assumed: CREATE EXTENSION
-- IF NOT EXISTS will not relocate an existing install, and Supabase
-- conventionally uses an "extensions" schema. A hardcoded public. fails twice

-- first, reporting a missing text search dictionary rather than a missing
-- function, which sends you looking in the wrong place.

Phase 2 ships this as migration `0041_profile_name_trigram.sql`:

```sql

**Rollback** drops the three indexes, the column, the two functions, and (optionally) the
extensions, in that order. All are additive, so rollback is clean — no data is lost.

> **Deployment note**: on managed Postgres (Supabase), extensions are conventionally installed into
> an `extensions` schema rather than `public`. Both `0040` and `0041` now resolve this themselves
> and raise a clear error if the extension is missing or somewhere unexpected, so no manual
> `search_path` check is needed before applying. Verified against both layouts.

> `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ... GENERATED ALWAYS` rewrites the table and takes an `ACCESS
EXCLUSIVE` lock. At current directory size this is a non-event, but it should still go out during
> a quiet window.

## Application Changes

All in `lib/server/directory.ts`. **Done in Phase 1:**

| Before                                | After                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `findMany` loads every active profile | `searchRanking()` resolves ids in SQL, then `inArray` narrows the load |
| JS `String.includes()` term filter    | removed                                                                |
| `matchScore()` ladder                 | `ts_rank_cd` + exact/prefix name boosts                                |
| `categorySearchText()`                | removed — categories sit in the vector at weight C                     |
| alphabetical tiebreak                 | kept — still needed for equal ranks                                    |

**Added in Phase 2:** `trigramRanking()`, called by `searchRanking()` only when the full-text map
comes back empty. It runs in a transaction so it can `SET LOCAL` both the `search_path` and
`pg_trgm.word_similarity_threshold`. Nothing else in the file changed — the caller cannot tell
which arm produced the ids.

`canonical()`, `jsonKeys()`, `categoryKeys()` and `countyKeys()` stay exactly as they are until
Phase 3; they still drive the filter chips.

Unchanged: every URL parameter, the `nearest` / `recommended` / `name` sorts, pagination, the map
view, and the rule that **nothing viewer-specific may enter the cached response**. Browse mode (no
term) is untouched — it computes no ranking and still shuffles.

## Risks & Open Questions

1. **Ranking changes are user-visible.** Result order will shift the moment Phase 1 ships. Worth a
   heads-up to anyone who knows the current ordering by heart.

2. **The CDN masks the rollout.** `/api/getDirectorySearch` sends
   `public, max-age=300, s-maxage=300, stale-while-revalidate=600`. The `max-age=300` is a
   **browser**-level directive, so a pana's own browser will serve stale results for five minutes
   after deploy. This already caused a working fix to look broken during directory testing.
   Recommended (**still awaiting sign-off**): `max-age=0, s-maxage=300`, which keeps the CDN win
   without the stale client.

3. **Threshold tuning is data-dependent — now tested at volume.** `word_similarity_threshold = 0.5`
   was calibrated against 15 active profiles, then re-measured against a synthetic 20k-name corpus
   (see Phase 2). It held: 0.6 loses real targets, 0.5 does not. What degrades instead is the rank
   of the intended business when many listings share the misspelled word, which is a property of
   the name distribution rather than of the threshold. Worth re-checking against real data once the
   directory is materially larger, but there is no longer an untested number here.

4. **`english` + `spanish` double-indexing inflates the vector.** Acceptable and correct for a
   bilingual community, but it roughly doubles vector size versus a single config.

5. **Stale-index hazard.** Any change to the `unaccent` dictionary requires a `REINDEX` of the
   dependent indexes, because we declared the wrapper IMMUTABLE.

6. **Latent bug, not in scope**: `listSelectedCategories` in `lib/profile.ts` iterates
   `Object.keys(categories)` without checking values, so it reports every category as selected.
   Worth fixing alongside the Phase 3 normalisation.
