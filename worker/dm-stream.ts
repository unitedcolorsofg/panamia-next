/**
 * Durable Object: DM Stream (actor mailbox)
 *
 * One instance per *recipient actor*, not per thread. A thread-scoped object
 * would only reach a member who already has that thread open, which is the one
 * case where they do not need a socket. An actor-scoped object is a mailbox:
 * the member holds one connection and anything addressed to them arrives on it
 * regardless of what is on screen — which is also what makes an unread badge
 * live for free, later, without a second transport.
 *
 *   POST /api/social/statuses (visibility: 'direct')
 *     └─ createStatus() writes the row          ← Postgres stays authoritative
 *          └─ for each actor in {recipients} ∪ {author}:
 *               env.DM_STREAM.idFromName(actorId) → stub.fetch('/notify')
 *                    └─ broadcast to that actor's open sockets, if any
 *
 * ## This object stores nothing
 *
 * It is a fan-out point, not a cache — the significant divergence from
 * SignalingRoom, which keeps participants and chat history in SQLite. There is
 * no table here and no `cleanupIfEmpty`, because there is nothing to clean up.
 *
 * That is what keeps this path cheap. A second store of message content would
 * need its own expiry, its own moderation reach, its own deletion path, and
 * would have to be reconciled with Postgres every time the two disagreed.
 * Holding nothing means none of those exist. If the member is offline the
 * notify is a no-op and they read the message from Postgres on next load,
 * exactly as they do today.
 *
 * Delivery is therefore **best-effort by construction**, and the ordinary read
 * path is the fallback rather than a recovery mechanism somebody has to write.
 * A dropped notify costs a refresh, never a message.
 *
 * ## The payload carries no message content
 *
 * Broadcasts say *that* something arrived and *which* conversation it belongs
 * to, never what it said. The client refetches through the normal authenticated
 * query, so every guard on the read path — expiry, blocks, hidden actors, the
 * request gate — still applies. Pushing content through here would route around
 * all of it, and would mean a message deleted a second later had already been
 * delivered in full.
 *
 * ## Identity comes from the Worker, never from the client
 *
 * The object's *name* is the actor id, set server-side in worker/index.ts after
 * the session is resolved. A client cannot ask for someone else's mailbox
 * because it never names one. This is the opposite of the signaling room, which
 * trusts `data.userId` from the client's own join message — survivable for a
 * proof-of-concept behind unguessable room ids, a hole for messaging.
 *
 * ## Hibernation
 *
 * Sockets are handed to the runtime with `state.acceptWebSocket()` rather than
 * `ws.accept()`, so this object is evicted between messages and billed only
 * while it runs. A mailbox is almost entirely idle — a member may hold a
 * connection for hours and receive four messages — so pinning it in memory
 * would bill hours of wall clock for milliseconds of work.
 *
 * The consequence is that **no instance field survives between messages**.
 * Nothing here keeps state across a wake; the live sockets are whatever
 * `state.getWebSockets()` returns at the moment it is called.
 *
 * Protocol:
 *   Server → Client:
 *     { type: "ready" }
 *     { type: "dm", conversationActorId: string | null, statusId: string, at: number }
 *   Client → Server:
 *     "ping"  → "pong", answered by the runtime without waking this object
