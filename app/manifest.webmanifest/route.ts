/**
 * Web app manifest, one per panaverse surface.
 *
 * A manifest describes exactly one installable app, but this deploy serves two
 * surfaces — Pana Mia at the apex and Pana Social at /s — and while
 * PANAVERSE_SUBDOMAINS is off they share a single origin. A static
 * public/manifest.webmanifest would therefore give both surfaces the same
 * name, icon and start URL: installing Pana Social from /s would put a Pana
 * Mia tile on the home screen.
 *
 * So this is generated the same way the root layout generates its metadata —
 * from the surface registry, keyed on the request. Adding a surface stays one
 * entry in surfaces.ts plus a pair of icons, never a second manifest to keep
 * in sync.
 *
 * Deliberately a route handler rather than Next's app/manifest.ts convention:
 * this app runs on vinext, not Next, so framework special-file conventions are
 * not guaranteed. Route handlers at dotted paths are proven here — /feed.json
 * and /.well-known/gpc.json both serve in production.
