        <div className="bg-muted/30 space-y-4 rounded-lg border p-6 text-sm">
          <p>
            <strong>What we collect:</strong> Account info you provide (email,
            name, profile details), content you create (articles, posts,
            photos), and minimal automatic data (IP address, browser info) for
            90 days.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Three data tiers:</strong> Your data is either{' '}
            <em>Persistent</em> (stored while your account is active),{' '}
            <em>Temporary</em> (auto-deleted after use), or{' '}
            <em>Peer Networking</em> (exchanged directly between users, outside
            our control after transmission).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Deletion:</strong> Most of your data is deleted immediately
            on request. Content that becomes community record (articles after 3
            months, completed events) can be anonymized but not fully removed,
            because the CC license you chose is irrevocable. Social posts are
            always fully deletable. Two things are never deleted on request:
            abuse reports, which have to outlive the accounts they concern, and
            anything already published to a network we do not run.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Nostr and federation:</strong> If you join the Resilience
            Network, your public key and group membership live in our systems
            and are deleted with your account — but posts you published to Nostr
            are signed, permanent, and hosted by relays we have no relationship
            with. We can remove them from our relay. Nobody can remove them from
            Nostr at large. ActivityPub works the same way: we send a Delete,
            and remote servers may honor it or ignore it. Your secret key (nsec)
            is never sent to us and we cannot recover it for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Third parties:</strong> We share data with Stripe
            (payments), GoHighLevel (CRM and newsletter), Cloudflare (hosting
            and email), and OAuth providers (Google, Apple). Each provider may
            retain data per their own policies after we request deletion.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Your rights:</strong> You can access, correct, delete, or
            export your data. We honor Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals. No
            data is sold.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>No minors:</strong> You must be 18 or older. Accounts
            belonging to minors are terminated and data deleted.
