            <strong>Prohibited:</strong> Content that is wholly AI-generated
            (text, images, audio, video) may not be published on the platform.
            This includes content from generative AI models presented as if it
            were human-created.

          <p>
            <strong>Permitted with disclosure:</strong> AI-assisted tools used
            as part of a human-directed creative process (e.g., grammar
            checking, translation assistance, code completion, accessibility
            descriptions) are permitted provided the user discloses AI
            assistance at the point of publication.

            <strong>Rationale:</strong> The CC licensing model depends on human
            authorship. Copyright law in most jurisdictions does not protect
            purely AI-generated works, which would undermine the CC license
            grant.
