/**
 * /admin/livesite -- is the site healthy, and is anything waiting on us?
 *
 * ## Boring when fine, loud when not
 *
 * A dashboard that always looks the same is a dashboard nobody reads, and one
 * nobody reads is worse than none at all because it is still *believed*. So
 * the attention strip renders a single quiet line when every queue is empty
 * and only grows rows when something is genuinely waiting. The page changes
 * shape when the site needs you, which is the one signal that survives being
 * seen every day.
 *
 * That is also why the queue counts are kept out of the stat band. A band of
 * five numbers that usually includes two zeroes trains you to skim all five.
 * The band carries things that are always worth a glance; the strip carries
 * things that are only ever there because they need doing.
 *
 * ## Why this does not contradict the overview
 *
 * `components/Admin/overview.tsx` deliberately shows no counts, on the
 * argument that a tool directory quoting numbers it does not own will drift
 * from the tools themselves. That still holds. The difference is ownership:
 * this page's whole job is those numbers, it reads them live per request, and
 * every one links to the tool that can clear it. The overview points at
 * doors; this one reads the building.
 *
 * ## Bands two and three
 *
 * Machinery (did the hourly job run?) now reads the `job_runs` ledger that
 * lib/jobs/ledger.ts writes from the scheduled handler. Infrastructure
 * (Cloudflare, the database) is still a dashed placeholder: it needs an API
 * token this app does not hold, so "we cannot tell" remains the honest
 * answer and showing it is the point. Same house pattern as `UNBUILT_TOOLS`
 * in lib/admin/views.ts -- write the gap down so it does not quietly become
 * folklore.
