/**
 * Accounts.
 *
 * ## What this replaces, and what it had to build first
 *
 * The mock that stood here listed its own blocker in its docblock: Lock was
 * "a write nobody has designed yet — there is no unlock flow, no audit row,
 * and no answer to what happens to a locked owner's live listings". All three
 * are answered now, and answering them was most of the work:
 *
 *   - **No unlock flow** → lock and unlock are one control and both write the
 *     same history table, because a suspension you cannot lift is a deletion
 *     with better manners.
 *   - **No audit row** → `user_locks` (migration 0058), with the reason NOT
 *     NULL and non-blank at the database level.
 *   - **Locked owner's listings** → nothing happens to them, deliberately,
 *     and the count is on screen before the button is pressed.
 *
 * ## The finding that changed the shape of this work
 *
 * The mock said `users.locked_at` existed and nothing wrote it. That was true
 * and it was the smaller half. Nothing *enforced* it either: the column was
 * read back by two endpoints as `locked`, and no sign-in path, no middleware
 * and no session check ever consulted it.
 *
 * So the obvious implementation — point the button at an UPDATE — would have
 * produced an admin console that reports success, a row that says Locked, and
 * a member who notices nothing. The worst kind of safety control is one that
 * looks like it worked.
 *
 * Locking is therefore three writes in one transaction (set the column, delete
 * the sessions, record the reason — `lib/admin/users.ts`) plus a refusal at
 * session creation in `auth.ts`. The transaction ends the access they have;
 * the hook denies the access they would get next. Neither half is sufficient
 * and the first one alone is actively misleading.
 *
 * ## Why filters live in the URL
 *
 * Search and filters are a plain GET form rather than client state, so this
 * page ships no JavaScript for the thing it does most. The useful consequence
 * is that a filtered view is a link: an admin can paste "locked accounts" into
 * a thread, and the back button steps through searches the way it should.
 *
 * ## The two filters that cannot be SQL
 *
 * `staff` and `owners` are applied after the read, not in the WHERE clause.
 * For staff that is forced: admin is the union of a column and an environment
 * variable, and no query can see `ADMIN_EMAILS`, so filtering in SQL would
 * silently omit every founder — the group most likely to be looked up that
 * way. See `listUsers()`, which adjusts the count to match so the pager does
 * not offer pages that turn out to be empty.
