/**
 * The programme admin view — the state of the programme, at a glance.
 *
 * This is a redraw of the Connector Dashboard the panas keep in Google Sheets:
 * same stat band, same pod and house breakdowns, same roster. Somebody who has
 * been reading the sheet should recognise it immediately and not have to be
 * retrained.
 *
 * What it changes is where the numbers come from. In the sheet every figure is
 * typed by hand and drifts — the header says twenty-six connectors over a list
 * of nineteen, and nobody can tell which is wrong. Here every number is
 * counted from the rows underneath it, so the band cannot disagree with the
 * table. `rosterTallies()` takes the roster as an argument for exactly that
 * reason: the band provably counts the same rows the editor renders.
 *
 * ## Why this page got smaller
 *
 * It used to carry everything: the application queue, the roster, the events,
 * the commitments table and the assign form, in one column. That is three jobs
 * stacked on one scroll — deciding who gets in, keeping the roster right, and
 * handing out work — and they are done by different people at different times.
 * Each now has its own page, and this one keeps only what answers "how is the
 * programme doing", which is the question somebody opening it cold is asking.
 *
 * Events stayed here rather than moving to Scheduling. They are the
 * programme's calendar, not one person's workload, and nothing about running
 * an event is attributed to a connector — `lead` is free text. Scheduling is
 * about who has room to take something on; an event has no owner to load.
 *
 * ## Why it lives here and not under /connectors
 *
 * It moved off the Connectors surface because of who it is for. Connectors is
 * a members' surface: a pana lands there to find their house, their pod and
 * what they said they would do. This page is nobody's own — it is a staff tool
 * that happens to be about connectors, and it belongs with the other staff
 * tools. `/connectors/admin` still answers and redirects here.
 *
 * The consequence is that the furniture changed colour. The panels, the stat
 * band and the table headers wear the admin blue rather than the Connectors
 * indigo, because an admin needs to be able to tell at a glance that they are
 * holding tools that change what other people see. House colours stay as they
 * are: those identify data, not the tool showing it.
 *
 * ## What the mock had that this does not
 *
 * Three panels are gone rather than ported, and the reason is the same in each
 * case: nothing could have filled them.
 *
 *   - **Birthdays.** There is no date of birth on a profile — not in the
 *     schema, not on the join form. Collecting one is a product decision with
 *     a privacy answer attached, not a gap to quietly fill.
 *   - **Open asks.** No table, and the fixture's "asked by" names were people
 *     who do not exist.
 *   - **Volunteer sign-up counts.** The mock read "3 more of 8". There is no
 *     sign-up table, so the 5 was invented. Events say how many are wanted
 *     and do not claim to know how many have come forward.
 *
 * The sheet's "Sync with Google Sheets" banner and "Add to the sheet" picker
 * are not here either: if this page exists, the sheet is no longer the system
 * of record and syncing back would just recreate the drift. The sheet's
 * read-only action log is worth having and is still missing — it wants an
 * audit trail behind it before it means anything.
