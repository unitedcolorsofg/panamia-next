/**
 * /e — what is on, and why you would want to be there.
 *
 * The question a person arrives with is "what is on, near me, soon, that I
 * would like", and the last clause is the hard one. The page this replaced
 * answered a different question — "list every upcoming event" — in a flat grid
 * sorted by date, which is a calendar rather than a discovery surface. The
 * obvious fix, a row of filter menus, is the same mistake in a new costume: it
 * requires the viewer to already know the answer and merely narrow to it, and
 * leaves anybody who arrived with "I don't know, surprise me" — which is most
 * people, most of the time — staring at controls.
 *
 * So the spine here is lanes, and every lane heading is a reason. The page
 * commits to a claim about why each event is in front of you, states it on the
 * card in checkable specifics, and gives you a control to say it got it wrong.
 * Four reasons, computed in lib/events/discovery.ts from columns that exist
 * today: hosts you follow, panas who have RSVPed, tags you have actually
 * turned up for, and hosts nobody has heard of yet.
 *
 * That last lane is the one worth defending. Every ranker reaches for
 * attendance first, and attendance is self-reinforcing — the big event is
 * shown because it is big, so it gets bigger. On a directory that exists for
 * small local makers that is not a neutral default, it is the product
 * backwards. So popularity appears exactly twice: inverted, as "new hosts,
 * small rooms", and at the very bottom under a heading admitting you would
 * have found those anyway.
 *
 * The calendar is kept, demoted to a second tab, because a discover page with
 * no "just show me everything" escape hatch is infuriating and people do
 * genuinely ask what is on Saturday. It is a plain chronological list grouped
 * by day and nothing more. The /mock/events draft carried type and county
 * facets there; neither is shipped, because `events` has no category column
 * and county lives a venue join away, and a facet whose values have to be
 * invented is a filter that will disagree with the data the first time
 * somebody checks.
