/**
 * Host an event.
 *
 * A server component now, where it used to be a client page that fetched its
 * own session and then rendered a spinner while it waited. Two things changed
 * and both of them wanted the server:
 *
 * - The signed-out case is a `redirect`, so it happens before any markup is
 *   sent rather than as a `useEffect` that fires after a flash of a card
 *   saying "Please sign in to host an event."
 * - The form's whole argument is the reach readout beside it, and that is
 *   built out of follower counts, past events and attendance history. Those
 *   are a handful of indexed queries on the server and would be four round
 *   trips and a loading state in the browser.
 *
 * See `app/e/new/_components/events-host.tsx` for why the page is shaped the
 * way it is.
