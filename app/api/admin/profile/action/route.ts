/**
 * Approve or decline a listing from the link in a staff email.
 *
 * ## Why this has no session check
 *
 * Because it is clicked from an inbox, usually on a phone, usually by someone
 * who is not signed in. The access key in the URL is the credential. That is a
 * deliberate trade and it is the reason `app/admin/layout.tsx` carries no
 * server-side gate — see `components/Admin/gate.tsx`.
 *
 * ## Why the write is not here
 *
 * `/admin/listings` is the second door onto the same decision and it
 * authenticates completely differently. Keeping the write in
 * `lib/server/listing-decision` means the two cannot drift into disagreeing
 * about what approving a business does. This route keeps only what is actually
 * specific to it: the capability check, the membership count, and the response
 * shape the confirmation page expects.
 *
 * `expect` is left at its default here. The link in a decline email still works
 * after an approve, because reversing a decision is a real thing staff do and
 * that email is sometimes the only artefact they still have.
