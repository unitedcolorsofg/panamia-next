/**
 * Put a task on somebody's board, or take one off.
 *
 * This is the second writer that drizzle/0056 existed to make safe. While
 * commitments lived in the membership blob, an admin adding a task and the
 * connector ticking something off at the same moment would have one of those
 * writes silently overwrite the other — no error, nothing logged, just a
 * change that did not happen. They are rows now, so they cannot.
 *
 * ## What staff can and cannot do
 *
 * Staff can create a task and delete any task. Staff cannot set progress:
 * that stays with the connector, because the only person who knows whether
 * the zines were dropped off is the person who did or did not drop them off,
 * and a programme where organisers mark their own asks complete is measuring
 * nothing.
 *
 * Deletion is the mirror image. A connector may delete what they wrote but
 * not what was assigned — otherwise an assignment is just a suggestion and
 * "done" cannot be told apart from "gone". Staff may delete either, because
 * an assignment made in error has to be retractable by whoever made it.
