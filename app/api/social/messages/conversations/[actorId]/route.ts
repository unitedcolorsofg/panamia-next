/**
 * GET /api/social/messages/conversations/[actorId] - one DM thread
 *
 * Returns the transcript oldest-first, the counterparty for the header, and
 * whether the composer may send at all.
 *
 * ADDRESSED BY ACTOR ID, NOT USERNAME
 *
 * Every other actor route in this API keys on username, which is right for
 * them: they back shareable public pages. A DM thread is not shareable -- two
 * people can read it and nobody else -- so a pretty URL buys nothing, while
 * username routing would need local/remote disambiguation that has exactly one
 * wrong answer (resolving a remote handle to the local actor of the same name
 * would open the wrong person's thread).

   * 'hold' is reported to the sender as 'allow', on purpose.
   *
   * dm-gate.ts holds a stranger's message in the recipient's Requests folder
   * and does not notify, and it is explicit that the sender is not told --
   * "your message was filed as a request" is a disclosure about the
   * recipient's settings. A composer that said so would leak exactly the fact
   * the gate is protecting, and it would leak it before a word was typed,
   * which is worse than the error message that design was avoiding.
   *
   * So the sender sees two states, not three. The message really is delivered
   * on 'hold' -- that is what holding means -- so 'allow' is not a lie about
   * what happens, only a silence about where it lands.
   *
   * 'refuse' is safe to surface because its wording is already deliberately
   * ambiguous: one string for blocked, `nobody`, and `panas`-without-a-mutual,
   * so it distinguishes nothing. See DIRECT_THREAD_REFUSED.
   *
   * The Accept/Delete banner in the transcript is a different thing entirely:
   * it is driven by the viewer's OWN Requests folder, which is their data to
   * see.
   *
   * The fallback is 'allow' for a remote counterparty, whom the gate declines
   * to judge because ActivityPub carries no DM-policy field.
