/**
 * GET /api/social/actors/me/groups - Groups the signed-in member belongs to
 *
 * The private counterpart to /api/social/actors/[username]/groups. That route
 * serves anyone looking at anyone, so it is filtered to public groups; this
 * one is only ever about the caller, so it includes private groups and each
 * membership's role.
 *
 * The distinction is enforced by construction rather than by a check: the
 * actor id passed to listMyGroups comes from the session, so there is no
 * username parameter that could be pointed at somebody else.
