/**
 * GET /api/social/blocks?kind=block|mute - The viewer's own block or mute list
 *
 * Outgoing rows only. You can see who you blocked; you can never see who
 * blocked you. That asymmetry is the whole point — a list of people who have
 * blocked you is a notification, and notifying someone that they were blocked
 * is how a block turns into an escalation.
 *
 * This backs the settings screen, which is the only place a block becomes
 * visible again after it is made.
