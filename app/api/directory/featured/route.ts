/**
 * Featured Panas — the rotating profile cards on the homepage.
 *
 * Deliberately not `getSearch()`: that loads every active profile and filters
 * in JS, which is far more work than the homepage needs to render three cards.
 * This selects only the columns a card shows and caps the result set.
 *
 * "Featured" here means a rotating sample of the directory rather than an
 * editorially curated set. There is no curation column on `profiles` yet, and
 * adding one would mean the section sat empty until somebody populated it.
 * Rotation shows a different slice of the community on each cache cycle, which
 * is the behaviour the design is after.
 *
 * Eligibility deliberately mirrors `getSearch()`. Anything the directory can
 * return, this can feature. That is not a stylistic preference: business
 * listings submitted through /form/list-your-business keep `profiles.userId`
 * NULL permanently and are administered through `profileOwners`, because
 * `userId` is unique and would otherwise cap a Pana at one listing (see
 * lib/server/profile-owners.ts). An inner join on `users` therefore excluded
 * every business listing in the directory — claimed or not — and left this
 * endpoint able to surface only sole traders whose own identity profile was
 * their listing.
