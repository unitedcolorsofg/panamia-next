/**
 * Apply to the Connectors programme, or change what you picked.
 *
 * Applying is not joining. The programme accepts people rather than letting
 * anyone who finds this URL award themselves a place, so this writes a
 * `pending` record and staff decide on it from the admin queue. This is the
 * same shape as `venues.status`, which goes `pending_review` → `active`
 * through `app/api/admin/venues/[slug]/approve/route.ts`.
 *
 * Writes `profiles.connector` on the signed-in human's OWN profile — matched
 * on `profiles.userId`, not through `getActiveProfile`. That helper resolves
 * the profile somebody is acting as, which may be a business listing they
 * administer, and membership belongs to the person rather than their shop.
 *
 * Re-posting is an edit, not a second application: `appliedAt`, the decision
 * and any existing commitments are carried over from the current record. So
 * an accepted member changing their houses stays accepted, and an applicant
 * fixing a typo does not go to the back of the queue or quietly re-open a
 * decision staff have already made.
 *
 * Neither `status` nor `tier` is ever read from the request body. Both are
 * things the programme grants, not things you can ask for.
