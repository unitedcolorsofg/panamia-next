/**
 * Say you will do something, or mark it done.
 *
 * This route used to read the membership blob, change it, and write the whole
 * thing back. That was safe only while a connector was the single writer of
 * their own record, and it said as much: "if a second writer ever appears,
 * this needs to move to its own table rather than grow a lock." The admin
 * console setting a task is that second writer, so drizzle/0056 moved the
 * data and this now writes rows.
 *
 * The practical difference is that two people editing the same board no
 * longer overwrite each other. Under the blob, an admin assigning a task
 * while the connector ticked something off would have one of those writes
 * silently lose — no error, nothing in a log, just a change that did not
 * happen. Row-level writes cannot do that to each other.
 *
 * ## This endpoint is only ever the connector themselves
 *
 * Everything here is scoped to the signed-in member's own profile. Staff
 * writes live under /api/admin/connectors, are gated separately, and are not
 * reachable from here by sending a different id — ownership is in the WHERE
 * clause of each write rather than checked beforehand, so a guessed id
 * belonging to somebody else updates nothing rather than being caught.

 * the admin queue would then be showing an application with work already
 * logged against it, which reads as though the decision had been made.
