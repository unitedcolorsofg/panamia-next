 * re-validated against profile_owners.
 *
 * Pending listing invitations ride along on this response rather than getting
 * an endpoint of their own. The shell already calls this once per load to fill
 * the account menu, and that menu is where an invitation has to appear, so a
 * second request would duplicate a round trip to tell the same component about
 * the same account. The added cost is one partial-indexed lookup that matches
