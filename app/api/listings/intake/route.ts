/**
 * Public business intake — the front door for getting listed.
 *
 * Deliberately unauthenticated. Most South Florida businesses hear about Pana
 * from another Pana, not from the site, and making them create an account
 * before they can tell us they exist loses them. This writes an *unclaimed*
 * listing: `profiles.userId` stays null, and the owner attaches an account
 * later via the claim flow (magic link to the address on the listing).
 *
 * Unclaimed rows are already first-class in the directory — see
 * lib/server/directory.ts, which ORs `isNull(profiles.userId)` with the
 * account-type check — so nothing here needs to touch `users.accountType`.
 * There is no user row to carry one.
 *
 * Submissions land inactive and go through the existing email-driven review:
 * the admin notification carries approve/decline links back to
 * /admin/profile/action, which flips `active` and mails the business. That
 * loop already works for rows without a user, since it keys off email.
