/**
 * Answer a pending listing invitation: "someone listed this and said it's
 * yours — is it?"
 *
 * The invitation itself is attacker-writable (pending_owner_email is set by
 * the public intake form), which is the entire reason this endpoint exists
 * rather than the sign-in hook simply granting ownership. See
 * lib/server/pending-listing-owner.ts for the threat model. Ownership moves
 * only through an authenticated, deliberate click by the person whose address
 * was named.
 *
 * Authorisation is the signed-in account's email matching the invitation, and
 * it is checked inside the helper against the row itself — not against
 * anything the client sends — so a guessed profileId gets 'not-found' rather
 * than a listing.
