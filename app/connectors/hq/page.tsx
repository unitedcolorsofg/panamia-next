/**
 * Connector HQ — the page a connector actually lives on.
 *
 * ## What changed, and why
 *
 * This page used to render a fixture: a hardcoded demo connector called
 * Bianca, shown to everybody who added `?as=connector` to the URL. Signed in
 * as yourself, HQ greeted you by somebody else's name — which is exactly the
 * bug that was reported against production. It now reads the signed-in
 * member's own membership from `profiles.connector`.
 *
 * ## What was removed, and what came back
 *
 * The events, open asks and birthdays panels were all deleted when this page
 * stopped being a fixture: all three rendered invented people — asks "asked
 * by" names that do not exist, birthdays for nobody — with no table behind
 * any of them. The note left here said they come back when they have real
 * data behind them.
 *
 * Events have. drizzle/0057 gave programme gatherings a table and the admin
 * console creates them, so "Coming up" is back in the sidebar showing this
 * member's pod plus anything programme-wide — real rows or an empty state,
 * never a placeholder.
 *
 * Open asks and birthdays are still gone, and for different reasons. Asks
 * have no table yet. Birthdays have no field: there is no date of birth
 * anywhere on a profile, so collecting one is a product decision with a
 * privacy answer attached rather than a gap to quietly fill.
 *
 * What stays is what is true: your own commitments, which you write; your
 * pod's real size, counted; and the tier ladder for your houses, which is
 * programme content from `lib/connectors/model.ts` rather than a person.
 *
 * The "next in your house" panel is the one piece that is not in the
 * spreadsheet today. The deck lists example actions per house per tier, and
 * leaving that on a slide means it gets read once during onboarding and never
 * again — which is precisely when somebody starts wondering what Tier 2 would
 * actually involve.
 *
 * ## From a slide to a thing you can do
 *
 * Those per-house action lists were read-only for their first few rounds: the
 * deck's thirty-six actions rendered as a ladder in the sidebar, with the only
 * route from "that one sounds like me" to "it is on my board" being to
 * remember the wording and retype it into the free-text form higher up the
 * page. So the single hardest question in the programme — a new Tier 1
 * connector asking what they are supposed to do on Monday — was answered by
 * an empty input.
 *
 * `ActionLibrary` now carries those lists in the main column with a commit
 * button on every line, and the sidebar keeps `TierLadder`, which is the part
 * that was never really about actions: it explains that tiers measure load
 * rather than seniority. Both read `lib/connectors/model.ts`, so the
 * programme's own wording stays the only copy of itself.
 *
 * ## Three ways not to see HQ
 *
 * Applying is not joining. This page is only the dashboard for an accepted
 * member; a pending applicant, a declined one and somebody who has never
 * applied each get their own message instead, because telling all three "you
 * are not a connector yet" would be wrong for two of them.
