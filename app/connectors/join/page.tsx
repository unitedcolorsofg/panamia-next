/**
 * Where "Apply to be a Connector" goes.
 *
 * The form is `components/connectors/join-form.tsx`; this file gives it a
 * route, metadata, and the session it needs.
 *
 * Applying writes to the signed-in member's own profile, so there is nowhere
 * to put the answers until there is an account to hang them on — hence the
 * redirect to sign in rather than an anonymous form that asks for an email and
 * tries to match it up later.
 *
 * Somebody who has already applied gets the same form with their answers in
 * it. The API treats a second POST as an edit that carries the decision over,
 * so this is also the "change my houses" page for an accepted member and the
 * "I picked the wrong pod" fix for one still waiting — and that is one page
 * fewer to keep in step with the first.
 *
 * A declined applicant is sent to HQ instead. Their edit would save and change
 * nothing, since the decision is carried over, so showing them a working form
 * would be a promise the API does not keep.
 *
 * `noindex`, because it requires a session. A search result that lands every
 * visitor on a sign-in redirect is a worse answer than not ranking at all.
