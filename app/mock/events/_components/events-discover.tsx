/**
 * /mock/events — the events discover page.
 *
 * The question is "what is on, near me, soon, that I would like", and the last
 * clause is the hard one. The first draft of this mock answered it with five
 * filter menus over a chronological list, which is a search results page: it
 * requires the viewer to already know the answer and merely narrow to it, and
 * it leaves anybody who arrived with "I don't know, surprise me" — which is
 * most people, most of the time — staring at controls.
 *
 * So the spine here is lanes, and every lane heading is a reason. The page
 * commits to a claim about why each event is in front of you, states it on the
 * card in checkable specifics, and gives you a control to say it got it wrong.
 * Four reasons, computed in `_reasons.ts` from columns that exist today:
 * hosts you follow, panas who have RSVPed, tags you have actually turned up
 * for, and hosts nobody has heard of yet.
 *
 * That last lane is the one worth defending. Every ranker reaches for
 * attendance first, and attendance is self-reinforcing — the big event is
 * shown because it is big, so it gets bigger. On a directory that exists for
 * small local makers that is not a neutral default, it is the product
 * backwards. So popularity appears exactly twice: inverted, as "new hosts,
 * small rooms", and at the very bottom under a heading admitting you would
 * have found those anyway.
 *
 * The calendar is kept, demoted to a second tab, because a discover page with
 * no "just show me everything" escape hatch is infuriating and people do
 * genuinely ask what is on Saturday. It is the old draft, intact, in the place
 * it earns rather than the place it was.
 *
 * Drawn inside a `BrowserFrame` rather than full bleed, which the README warns
 * makes a surface read as a picture of a website. That warning is about
 * `/mock/feed`, where the question was "does this feel like its own site".
 * Here the hostname *is* half the proposal — `directory.pana.social/events`
 * does not resolve today — so the address bar is part of what is under review.
