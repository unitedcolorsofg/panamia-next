/**
 * Fixtures for /mock/events — the events discover page.
 *
 * The argument of this mock is in the difference between two questions. The
 * live `/e` page answers "list every upcoming event" and `/directory/events`
 * answers "which events match this word". Neither answers the question an
 * actual person arrives with, which is "what is on, near me, soon, that I
 * would like" — a question nobody can type into a search box because it has
 * four clauses and three of them are not words.
 *
 * The first draft of this mock answered it with five filter menus, which was
 * the same mistake in a new costume: a search page still demands that the
 * viewer already know the answer and merely narrow to it. A discover page has
 * to propose, and to say why it proposed. So these fixtures are shaped to
 * support *reasons* rather than facets — the records below carry who hosts an
 * event, which panas have RSVPed, what it is tagged, and how much the host has
 * run before, because those are the four things that can justify showing it to
 * someone. The justification itself is computed in `_reasons.ts`, never typed
 * here; a fixture that carried its own reason would prove nothing.
 *
 * Fields are annotated with the column they stand in for, per
 * app/mock/README.md, so wiring this to real data is mechanical. Nothing here
 * reads the database and nothing here is localized.
 *
 * Dates are written as labels rather than as `Date` objects on purpose. A mock
 * that computes "this weekend" from `Date.now()` renders differently depending
 * on the day the reviewer opens it, and a design review that disagrees with
 * itself on a Monday is not a review.
