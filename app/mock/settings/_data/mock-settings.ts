 * for the publishing licence, and the HighLevel contact for the marketing
 * record.
 *
 * The member is imported rather than redeclared, for the same reason
 * `_data/panaverse.ts` imports her: there is one account, and a settings page
 * that shows a different person from the feed would be arguing against itself.
