/* Design mock for the account settings page — the live one is
 * /account/user/edit.
 *
 * The page it replaces is two shadcn cards on white: a form headed "Update
 * Your Account Settings", and a second card headed "Advanced Settings" holding
 * an accordion with four unrelated things in it — change your email, your
 * marketing consent, your signing keys, and your publishing licence. It is the
 * one surface a member reaches from both pana.social and social.pana.social,
 * and it is the only one that carries no Pana Mia design at all.
 *
 * Three things are wrong with it, and this mock is an argument about each:
 *
 * 1. IT DOES NOT SAY WHERE A SETTING APPLIES. The surface switcher already
 *    promises "Account settings — applies everywhere", and the page never
 *    makes good on it. So the redesign is organised around scope: every group
 *    states it, and the toolbar can flip which masthead the page is wearing to
 *    show that the content underneath does not change. That is the whole claim,
 *    rendered rather than asserted.
 *
 * 2. "ADVANCED" IS NOT A CATEGORY. It describes how nervous we are about a
 *    control, not what the control is for — which is how a marketing-consent
 *    setting with legal weight ended up collapsed in the same drawer as a key
 *    rotation. Here the accordion is gone and the page is six named sections a
 *    member can scan from the nav without opening anything.
 *
 * 3. CONSEQUENCES ARRIVE TOO LATE. Changing a screenname deletes every post and
 *    DM on the account; today you find that out in the dialog *after* you have
 *    typed a new one and pressed Update. Here it appears beside the field the
 *    moment the value differs.
 *
 * Nothing new is invented: it is the same fields, the same HighLevel channels,
 * the same licence options, wearing `.profile-card`, `.identity-pill`, and
 * `.card-flag` — the primitives the feed and the profile already use. */
