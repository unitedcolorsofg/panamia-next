/* The composer at the top of the feed.
 *
 * The production feed puts a bare `+` button in the bottom-right corner, which
 * is a mobile pattern borrowed onto a desktop page: it hides the single most
 * important action behind an unlabelled icon that says nothing about what you
 * can post. This is the opposite — an open box, addressed to the reader by
 * name, with every post type named next to it.
 *
 * The chips are not decoration either. Voice memos and group posts already
 * exist in the schema and nobody finds them, because there is currently no
 * surface that mentions them.
 *
 * It renders in the empty state too. A new account is told to post — removing
 * the box it would post in is how an onboarding step becomes a dead end.
 *
 * The picker is the real `components/social/destination-picker`, not a copy.
 * This mock previously had its own, and two files rendering the same control
 * is how the mock and the product quietly stop agreeing about what shipped.
 *
 * One thing was lost in the merge, deliberately: this mock used to show a
 * new-account reach line naming the viewer's county. There is no county field
 * on a social account, so the real picker cannot say it without inventing the
 * data. Worth building -- "anyone nearby" is a better answer than "Miami-Dade
 * and Broward" for someone who is neither -- but it needs the field first. */
