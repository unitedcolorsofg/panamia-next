/* Design mock for the Pana Social feed, rendered as Pana Social.
 *
 * An earlier draft of this file argued the opposite, and said so at the top:
 * the feed was deliberately not an app shell, because an embedded product with
 * its own navigation is how you end up with a Pana Mia member looking at a
 * page that has no Pana Mia on it. That was the right call while the feed was
 * a section of panamia.club.
 *
 * It stopped being the right call the moment Pana Social got its own front
 * door at social.panamia.club and its own drawn mark. Wearing the main site's
 * scallop header and demoting "Pana Social" to an eyebrow no longer reads as
 * continuity — it reads as the social product never having arrived. The
 * continuity now lives where it should: in the lettering, the palette, and the
 * switcher, all of which survive the hostname change on their own.
 *
 * So this is full bleed and sticky, with no page wrapper around it. The only
 * non-product element is the mock toolbar above the masthead, which is styled
 * as developer chrome precisely so nothing else has to be.
 *
 * Two columns on desktop: the timeline, and a rail of context that stacks
 * beneath it on mobile. */
