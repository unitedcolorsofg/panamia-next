 * The feed is the timeline surface: many authors, one reader. That is the one
 * structural difference from /mock/profile, where every post belongs to the
 * profile owner — so posts here carry their own `author` rather than borrowing
 * one from the page.
 *
 * Deliberately hardcoded and deliberately not localized: this route exists to
 * agree on the *shape* of the timeline before it is wired to `socialStatuses`,
 * `socialActors`, `socialAttachments`, `socialFollows`, or `relayGroups`.
 * Every field is annotated with the column it stands in for, so the swap to
 * real data is mechanical.
 *
 * Feature coverage is not decorative. Content warnings, attachments, location,
 * CC licenses, boosts, replies, and voice memos all already exist in
 * components/social — the redesign has to have an answer for each of them, so
 * each one appears at least once below.
