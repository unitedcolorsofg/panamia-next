/* Fixture data for the DM chat view at /mock/dm-chat.
 *
 * /mock/dms asked a question - mail or chat - and it has been answered: chat
 * UX, on the direct-status substrate we already have, with live delivery.
 * docs/CHAT-ROADMAP.md records that decision. This route is the next thing
 * that has to exist, because the roadmap's own Path A is blocked on it: a
 * socket has nothing to update until there is a thread for it to update.
 *
 * So this is not a comparison. It is one design, drawn against the substrate
 * it actually has to run on, and the fixtures are chosen to put the awkward
 * parts of that substrate on screen rather than crop them out.
 *
 * THE CONSTRAINTS THIS SET EXISTS TO MAKE VISIBLE
 *
 * 1. DMs expire after seven days. `status.ts` stamps every `visibility:
 *    'direct'` row with `expiresAt = now + 7 days`, unconditionally, and
 *    `notExpired()` in timeline.ts hides it afterwards. The row survives in
 *    Postgres - purge-expired.ts deliberately leaves DMs alone - but it is
 *    invisible to everyone. Mail made that survivable: a letter you cannot
 *    find after a week is annoying. Chat makes it a bug report, because the
 *    promise of a transcript is that it is a transcript.
 *
 *    And because `expiresAt` is stamped per row at write time, a conversation
 *    does not expire as a unit. It erodes from the oldest message forward, so
 *    an active thread is a sliding seven-day window and the beginning of the
 *    exchange is always the first thing to go. THREAD_BEE carries this: its
 *    opening message has hours left while the reply under it has two days.
 *
 * 2. The gate has three answers, not two. dm-gate.ts returns allow / hold /
 *    refuse, and every refusal returns one identical string so a blocked
 *    sender cannot tell a block from a closed inbox by comparing wording.
 *    That is a safety property, and safety properties get designed away when
 *    nobody draws them, so both non-allow states are rendered here.
 *
 * 3. Delivery is best-effort; Postgres is truth. The socket is an accelerator
 *    on top of a write that already happened, so the UI needs an honest state
 *    for "written but not yet confirmed" and an honest state for "the socket
 *    is gone but your messages are still sending".
 *
 * 4. It federates, and that is the reason to keep the substrate. MART is a
 *    real remote actor shape - a DM to a Mastodon account works today because
 *    this is how Mastodon DMs already work.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT: presence dots and typing indicators. The chat
 * model at /mock/dms had both. CHAT-ROADMAP puts them out of scope, because
 * they are the expensive half of "realtime" - delivery is one socket, while
 * presence is a per-actor fanout that has to survive reconnects and lie
 * convincingly when it cannot. Drawing them here would quietly re-add the
 * cost the decision just removed.
 *
 * Every field is annotated with the column it stands in for, per the
 * convention in app/mock/README.md, so swapping to live data is mechanical.
