/* Primitives for the DM chat view.
 *
 * Mostly a narrower copy of /mock/dms' primitives, and the narrowing is the
 * interesting part: `DmAvatar` there takes an `online` prop, and this one
 * does not. Presence is out of scope per CHAT-ROADMAP, and the cheapest way
 * to keep a thing out of scope is to make the component unable to express it.
 * A boolean nobody passes today is a boolean somebody passes next quarter.
 *
 * Colour follows the contrast rule recorded in app/globals.css, which is a
 * constraint rather than a preference: flame is a high-luminance orange, so
 * cream on flame measures 2.42:1 and fails even the 3:1 large-text bar, while
 * cream on indigo is 9.01:1. The warm tokens carry ink text; only indigo and
 * ink carry cream. That is why the viewer's own bubble is indigo and not the
 * brand orange. */

   Mail could get away with not mentioning it. A transcript cannot, because a
   transcript that silently loses its own first page is indistinguishable from
   data loss.

   The window is thirty days, raised from seven after this view was drawn
   against it. The chip is not a seven-day artefact and does not retire at
   thirty: the stamp is per row, so the conversation erodes from its oldest
   message forward at any window, which is why this renders per message rather
