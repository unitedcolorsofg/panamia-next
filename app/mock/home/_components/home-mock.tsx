/**
 * The homepage, inside a review harness.
 *
 * This route renders exactly the sections `/` renders — same components, same
 * copy, same stylesheet — with two things added: a control bar, and a switch
 * on the one variable worth arguing about.
 *
 * It holds no copy and no layout of its own on purpose. When this file
 * carried its own version of the page, the mock and the real page were two
 * implementations that happened to agree, and the agreement was maintained by
 * hand. Now the only difference between this route and `/` is the bar at the
 * bottom of the window and which value `data-density` takes, so the mock
 * cannot drift from the thing it is previewing.
 *
 * On density: the old site's vertical rhythm was a full-viewport hero plus
 * `py-16 md:py-24` on every band, which is where most of its empty space came
 * from. Rather than bury a new number, the bar carries a switch: `compact` is
 * what `/` ships, `roomy` is what the site used to do, and the two are a
 * click apart so the difference can be judged rather than argued about. Only
 * the rhythm changes — no copy, no colour, nothing reflows to a different
 * layout.

/**
 * Publishes the mock control bar's height as `--mock-chrome-h`.
 *
 * The bar floats over the foot of the window on this route, so it covers the
 * bottom of whatever the first screen ends with — which, since the first
 * screen ends with the scroll hint, would be the one line on the page whose
 * entire job is to be read. Measuring it means the first screen ends where
 * the *usable* window ends rather than where the window ends.
 *
 * It has to be measured rather than written down: the bar is a wrapping flex
 * row, so it is one line on a laptop and three on a phone, and its height
 * moves with its content rather than with a breakpoint.
 *
 * Mock-only. `/` has no bar, never sets the variable, and the `0px` fallback
 * in the stylesheet puts the town back on the fold.
