/* Fixture data for the Pana Social direct-message mocks at /mock/dms.
 *
 * One fixture set, rendered twice: once as mail, once as chat. That is the
 * whole point of the route - if each model had its own conversations, the
 * comparison would be between the writing, not between the designs.
 *
 * The honest-comparison problem: long paragraphs flatter mail and short bursts
 * flatter chat, so a fixture set of only one kind rigs the result. Both are
 * here. BEE is a two-paragraph collaboration pitch that would feel absurd as
 * chat bubbles; JDOWNS is six words at a time that would feel absurd as
 * stacked letters. Whichever model wins has to carry both, because real panas
 * write both.
 *
 * What this stands in for in the real schema: there is no messages table. A DM
 * today is a `socialStatuses` row with `visibility: 'direct'` and the
 * recipient's actor URI in `recipientTo`. Threads are not stored - they would
 * be walked through `inReplyToId`, which is indexed. Every field below is
 * annotated with the column it would read from, so the swap is mechanical.
