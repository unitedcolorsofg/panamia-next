/* Design mock for Pana Social direct messages - two competing models on one
   route, switched from the mock toolbar.
 *
   Pana Social has no DM feature today, but it is not starting from zero: a DM
   is already expressible as a `socialStatuses` row with `visibility: 'direct'`
   and the recipient in `recipientTo`, there are two API routes, and voice
   memos send this way in production. What does not exist is any conversation
   UI, any threading, and any gating.

   So the open question is which shape that substrate grows into - async mail
   on the existing schema, or realtime chat on the Durable Object path already
   sketched in docs/CHAT-ROADMAP.md, whose own first open question is this
   exact decision. Both are rendered from one fixture set so the difference on
   screen is a difference in design rather than in the writing.

   Surfaces come from the same registry the Worker routes hostnames on, so the
   masthead cannot fly a mark for a surface that does not exist, and reading it
   server-side keeps `process.env` out of the client bundle.

   Noindex because it is a fixture route, not a real inbox. */
