/* Presentation metadata for the panaverse chrome, shared by every mock that
 * wears it — /mock/panaverse compares the surfaces, /mock/feed lives inside
 * one. It sits at app/mock/_data rather than under a single route because the
 * moment two mocks describe the same masthead from two files, they drift, and
 * a switcher that disagrees with itself is worse than no switcher.
 *
 * Unlike the other mocks, the surfaces here are NOT invented. The live ones
 * come straight out of `lib/panaverse/surfaces.ts` — the same registry the
 * Worker routes hostnames on — so this mock cannot drift from what actually
 * ships. The page reads the registry on the server and hands it down; only the
 * presentation metadata below is a fixture.
 *
 * The "rooms" are the honest part of the picture. Events, peer mentoring, and
 * the resilience network are not roadmap items: they are real routes that
 * exist in `app/` today, served from the main site. Showing them as rooms
 * rather than surfaces is the argument that a panaverse offering does not need
 * its own hostname to be real — and that promoting one later is a registry
 * entry, not a rewrite.
