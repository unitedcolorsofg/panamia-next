 * The homepage hero, with the scope control moved into the search pill.

 * why with unusual candour: the placeholder "says 'Search panas, businesses,
 * groups, events' … while Enter used to land in the businesses-only scope — so
 * three of the four kinds it names were advertised and then dropped on
 * submit." The fix at the time was to widen Enter to Everything and let the
 * scope chips on the results page sort it out afterwards.
 *
 * That trade is what the panas pushed back on. It moves the choice *after* the
 * search, which means every query is run against the wrong corpus once before
 * it is run against the right one, and the control that fixes it lives on a
 * page you have to reach first. Moving the scope into the pill puts the choice
 * where the question is asked, and costs the hero nothing it was using: the
 * placeholder's four-noun list existed only to stand in for the control that
 * is now sitting an inch to its left.
 *
 * Open the menu from the switcher to see the second half of this view — the
 * four destinations, named, before anyone presses Enter.

/**
 * `/explore/groups`.
 *
 * Two changes from today worth arguing in review.
 *
 * First, groups become **public**. `SCOPE_REQUIRES_PANA` currently gates them
 * alongside panas, which means a group is invisible to exactly the people it
 * needs to recruit — you have to already be a member of the club to discover
 * the thing that would make you want to join it. Panas stay gated because a
 * member list is personal data; a group is a public notice board with a door
 * on it, and the door is `joinPolicy`, not the search index.
 *
 * The roster is the part that stays private. Public page, private membership:
 * a signed-out visitor sees every group and every fact that would make them
 * want to join one, but not who is already in it. That split is what lets the
 * page recruit without publishing the club's member list to the open web — see
 * `GroupCard` for where the line falls.
 *
 * Second, the member's own groups get a shelf above the results. A group page
 * is somewhere you return to, unlike a directory listing, and burying "the
 * four I'm already in" under a search box treats a regular visit as a fresh
 * discovery every time. Signed out there is no such shelf, because there are
 * no groups of yours to put on it — the page is then a flat list of everything.
