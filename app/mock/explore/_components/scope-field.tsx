/**
 * The search field, with the scope toggle inside it.
 *
 * This is the whole proposal in one component. Today this control lives on
 * `/directory/search` and on the four `/directory/[scope]` pages, which means
 * the only way to discover that the club has events, groups and members is to
 * first search for a business and then notice a chip row above the results.
 * The club's biggest, most-used input — the one in the middle of the
 * homepage — offers no choice at all.
 *
 * So the toggle moves to the front door, and the pages it opens move apart.
 *
 * Three things changed from the live `ScopeMenu`, and each is a consequence of
 * that move rather than a redesign for its own sake:
 *
 * 1. **No "Everything".** Argued at length on `EXPLORE_SCOPES` in `_data.ts`.
 *    Short version: the menu promised four kinds and Enter delivered one, and
 *    this is the half of that contradiction worth keeping.
 *
 * 2. **Each row names its destination.** The live menu's scopes are four
 *    spellings of one results page, so where you land needs no explanation.
 *    These four are different products — one has a map, one has a calendar,
 *    one has a join button — and a control that changes which product you are
 *    in should say so before Enter rather than after.
 *
 * 3. **It is a button, not a `<Link>`.** The live menu's items are links
 *    precisely because each scope is a real, shareable route, and that stays
 *    true in the real build. Here they are buttons because the mock's entire
 *    demonstration is moving between these views, and a link would walk the
 *    reviewer out of the page on the first click.
 *
 * Built from `.directory-suggest-pill-lead`, `.surface-pill`, `.surface-panel`
 * and `.surface-option` — the shipping primitives, down to the class names, so
 * what you are looking at is the real thing with its hrefs turned into state.
