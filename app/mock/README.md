# Design Mocks (`/mock/*`)

Static, hardcoded design mocks used to agree on a surface before it is built
against real data. Nothing here queries the database, and every route is
`noindex` so the mocks never reach search results.

These are not prototypes to be shipped as-is. They are the argument for a
design, written in the real design system so the argument is honest: if a
layout only works with invented spacing or colours that are not in
`app/globals.css`, that shows up here rather than in review.

| Route                     | Description                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/mock/home`              | Homepage cut to four cards, built from the Connectors deck        |
| `/mock/profile`           | Personal profile page (pana page) redesign                        |
| `/mock/profile-next`      | Pana page, second pass: identity rail left, tabbed content right  |
| `/mock/feed`              | Pana Social feed redesign, including the empty feed               |
| `/mock/panaverse`         | Panaverse chrome: masthead, surface switcher, identity            |
| `/mock/settings`          | Account settings — one page, either masthead                      |
| `/mock/directory`         | Directory search results, pre-map                                 |
| `/mock/directory-unified` | One directory theme across businesses, panas, groups and events   |
| `/mock/explore`           | Scope moved into the search bar; directory narrowed to businesses |
| `/mock/groups`            | Groups landing and discover, as two steps of one flow             |
| `/mock/dms`               | Direct messages, as two competing models behind one switch        |
| `/mock/events`            | Events discover page, drawn as `directory.pana.social/events`     |

## Viewing the Pana Social surface

`/mock/feed` mocks a page of `social.panamia.club`, not a page of
`panamia.club`. The root layout picks its chrome from the request hostname via
`resolveSurface`, so the hostname you use decides what you see:

```
http://localhost:3002/mock/feed          → Pana Mia masthead wraps the mock
http://social.localhost:3002/mock/feed   → Pana Social, standalone
```

Use the second one when reviewing the feed. Browsers route `*.localhost` to
the loopback address with no hosts-file entry, and `resolveSurface` maps
`social.localhost` exactly the way it maps `social.panamia.club`, so this
exercises the real production rule rather than a preview-only shortcut.

## Conventions

- **`_data/`** holds all fixtures and their types. Fields are annotated with
  the real column they stand in for (`socialStatuses.content`,
  `profiles.primaryImageCdn`, and so on) so swapping to live data is
  mechanical rather than interpretive.
- **`_components/`** holds the mock's components. Leading `_` keeps both
  folders out of the router.
- **`app/mock/_data/` and `app/mock/_components/`** hold the pieces more than
  one mock needs — the surface registry fixtures, the masthead, the surface
  switcher, the browser frame. A mock-specific folder stays inside that mock;
  it only moves up when a second mock imports it.
- **Shared primitives** live in `app/globals.css` and are deliberately reused
  across mocks. A post card looks the same on the profile and in the feed
  because it is literally the same `.profile-card`.
- **Derived numbers are computed, never typed.** Tab counts come from the same
  function that returns the rendered list, so a mock cannot advertise a number
  it does not render.
- Each mock ends with a footer note naming its own route, so a screenshot
  taken out of context still says where it came from.

## Mocks that compare two designs

`/mock/dms` is the first mock that renders **two** designs rather than one, so
it has a convention of its own worth repeating if another comparison mock is
built.

- **One fixture set, both models.** Each design reads the same `_data/`
  threads. A comparison where each side gets its own content is not a
  comparison, it is two demos.
- **Fixtures are written against the weaker case for each side.** Long
  paragraphs flatter mail and short bursts flatter chat, so both appear: one
  thread is two paragraphs, another is six-word replies. Choosing content that
  suits the design you prefer is how a mock pre-decides the question it was
  built to ask.
- **Shared primitives stay small on purpose.** Only the pieces that should look
  identical in both models — avatar, name, unread badge — are shared. Pushing
  the list, the transcript, and the composer into one component with a
  `variant` prop would converge the two designs and defeat the comparison.
- **Both models' costs stay on screen.** The gains and costs of the inactive
  model are rendered alongside the active one, so whichever is on screen cannot
  appear free.

## Legal terms

`app/mock` is classified `exempt` in `app/legal/terms/namespaces.json`: the
mocks collect nothing, store nothing, and are not a user-facing feature.
