/* Fixture data for the personal profile mock at /mock/profile.
 *
 * A personal profile IS a Pana Social profile: posts, Panas, groups. It is not
 * a directory listing — the schema already draws that line, since
 * DIRECTORY_ACCOUNT_TYPES is ['small_business', 'hybrid'] and 'personal' is
 * deliberately excluded from the directory. Business listings get their own
 * design, so nothing here models galleries, categories, or storefront details.
 *
 * Deliberately hardcoded and deliberately not localized: this route exists to
 * agree on the *shape* of a person's profile before any of it is wired to
 * `profiles`, `socialActors`, `socialFollows`, or `relayGroups`. Every field
 * below is annotated with the column it is standing in for, so the swap to
 * real data is mechanical.
