/* Design mock for a Pana Social group home page.
 *
 * Deliberately built out of the feed and profile mocks rather than beside
 * them. The post cards are literally imported from /mock/feed — not copied,
 * imported — because the design claim being made is that a group post IS a
 * status with a group_id on it, exactly as docs/GROUPS-ROADMAP.md proposes. If
 * a group post needed its own card, the schema would be wrong. Reusing the
 * component is how the mock argues the schema is right.
 *
 * The hero is the profile's hero with a privacy state and a join action, for
 * the same reason: a group is an actor, so it wears an actor's furniture.
 *
 * The toolbar switches viewer state rather than content state, which is the
 * one real departure from the feed mock. A group looks materially different
 * depending on who is asking, and that difference is the whole design problem.
 * `locked` is the important one. */

                    edge with nothing to suggest it is there — the strip
