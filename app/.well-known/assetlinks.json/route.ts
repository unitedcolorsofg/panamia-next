/**
 * /.well-known/assetlinks.json — Android App Links.
 *
 * Android only opens a link in an app when the site that owns the domain says
 * it may. This is that statement: it names the app and the signing keys, and
 * Android fetches it over https before honouring any pana.social link.
 *
 * Without it, App Links still install — and silently do nothing. Every link
 * opens in the browser, which is indistinguishable from never having set them
 * up, because there is no error anywhere to say the verification was refused.
 *
 * Served from a route rather than public/ so the fingerprints can come from
 * the environment. They are not secret — anything here is world-readable by
 * design, and Google publishes the Play signing certificate — but they differ
 * per environment, and a preview Worker serving production's fingerprints
 * would claim links for an app it cannot possibly be.
 *
 * @see https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/verify-android-applinks

 * Plural on purpose, and this is the part that trips people: with Play App
 * Signing there are always at least two. Google re-signs the uploaded bundle
 * with its own key, so what lands on a member's phone carries the Play signing
 * certificate, while local and internal-test builds still carry the upload
 * certificate. List only one and links verify for half the builds — typically
 * the half that was never tested, because the developer's own device runs the
 * other.
 *
 * Both are shown under `Release > Setup > App signing` in the Play Console.
