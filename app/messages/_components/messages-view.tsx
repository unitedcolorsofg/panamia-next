/* The container: which thread is open, and what is in flight.
 *
 * Selection lives in component state rather than the URL. A DM thread is not
 * a shareable address -- the only person who can open it is the one already
 * signed in as a participant -- so a route segment would add a path that reads
 * like a permalink and is not one. It also keeps the list mounted, which is
 * what makes switching threads feel like a chat app instead of a navigation.
 *
 * The one piece of local state that is not selection is `pending`: the text of
 * a message that has been submitted and not yet come back from the server. The
 * send hook deliberately does not insert optimistically into the cache, so
 * this is held here and rendered as a distinct "Sending" bubble, then dropped
 * when the refetch returns the real row. */
