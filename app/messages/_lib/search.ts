 * Searching the message list.

 * One box asks two questions, which is why these helpers live apart from the
 * component that calls them.
 *
 * "Which of my conversations is this?" is answered locally and instantly --
 * the threads are already in memory, so going to the network to re-filter an
 * array the client is holding would add latency to the only part of this that
 * could be immediate.
 *
 * "Who else could I write to?" cannot be answered locally at all, because a
 * pana the viewer has never messaged appears in no list this page has loaded.
 * That half goes to /api/social/actors/search.
 *
 * The box asks both because a member who opens Messages in order to write to
 * someone does not know -- and should not have to care -- which of the two
 * they are doing. Splitting them into two controls would mean picking the
 * wrong one is possible, and the wrong one looks empty rather than wrong.
