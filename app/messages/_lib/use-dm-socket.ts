/**
 * useDmSocket — live DM delivery.
 *
 * Opens one socket to `/ws/dm` and turns each notification into a react-query
 * invalidation. The socket carries no message content, so this hook never
 * writes to the cache: it only says "this is stale", and the ordinary
 * authenticated queries fetch the actual message.
 *
 * That is the whole design. Postgres stays the single source of truth, every
 * read guard (expiry, blocks, hidden actors, the request gate) keeps applying
 * because nothing bypasses the read path, and a dropped socket degrades to the
 * polling the queries already do rather than to a missing message.
 *
 * ## What this replaces
 *
 * `useConversation`'s 15-second `refetchInterval`. That stays as the fallback —
 * removing it would make a failed socket silently fatal — but with the socket
 * open the visible latency is the round trip, not up to fifteen seconds.
 *
 * ## Surviving a suspend
 *
 * A socket is not reliably told when it dies. An OS suspending a backgrounded
 * app, a closed laptop, or a changed network can tear the connection down
 * without a close frame ever arriving, which leaves `readyState` reading OPEN
 * on a connection that is gone — and `send()` on one of those buffers instead
 * of throwing. A hook that only reconnects on `onclose` would sit on that
 * forever.
 *
 * So liveness is asserted rather than assumed, two ways: the heartbeat demands
 * an answer within `PONG_TIMEOUT_MS` and closes the socket if none arrives, and
 * returning to the foreground re-probes immediately instead of waiting for the
 * next beat.
 *
 * This matters most on mobile — the app is a Capacitor WebView around this same
 * deploy, so backgrounding is every session rather than an occasional event —
 * but nothing about the fix is mobile-specific, and a desktop laptop lid hits
 * exactly the same case.
 *
 * ## What a socket cannot do
 *
 * Deliver to an app that is not running. Every platform suspends sockets with
 * the process, so a backgrounded phone receives nothing here regardless of how
 * this is written; that is what push notifications are for, and
 * `handleNotify`'s `delivered` count in worker/dm-stream.ts is where they hook
 * in. See docs/MOBILE-ROADMAP.md step 4.
 *
 * ## Explicitly not here
 *
 * Presence, typing indicators, read receipts. The socket could carry them and
 * the cost would be real: a typing indicator is a message per keystroke per
 * recipient, and presence means publishing when a member is at their desk. A
 * two-person DM thread does not need either. Group and event rooms may earn
 * them later.
