/**
 * Suspense fallback shared by every search route — /d, /directory/search and
 * /directory/search/<term> — so the three render an identical shell.
 *
 * This is a skeleton of the real page rather than a page of its own, and the
 * reason is sharper than "a nicer spinner". `DirectorySearchContent` is a
 * client component calling `useSearchParams()`, so the boundary around it
 * re-suspends *on hydration* — measured on a throttled connection, the real
 * directory paints, and then roughly four seconds later it is torn down and
 * replaced by this for ~300ms before coming back. A fallback is therefore not
 * a placeholder shown before anything exists; it is an interruption shown over
 * a page the visitor is already reading.
 *
 * That makes the old fallback — a centred headline over a short "Loading…"
 * card — about the worst possible shape. It was a different page, and being
 * ~600px shorter than the real one it dragged the site footer up into the
 * middle of the viewport and dropped it again. The footer moving was the most
 * visible part of the flash, more so than the content changing.
 *
 * Two things fix that, and both have to hold:
 *
 * - The root element reproduces the real page's layout container exactly:
 *   `.dirsearch.dirsearch-split` with `data-view="list"` and the same
 *   `.dirsearch-panes` beneath it. The directory cannot hoist its chrome
 *   outside the boundary the way /groups does — `SearchBand` lives inside the
 *   client component and depends on its search state — so the fallback has to
 *   bring the chrome with it. Wearing `.dirsearch-split` also means this
 *   inherits the same `body:has(.dirsearch-split)` viewport lock and the same
 *   `footer { display: none }` above the 72rem breakpoint, which is what
 *   makes the swap a no-op for layout there.
 * - `min-h-screen` as the floor, but only below that breakpoint, where the
 *   page scrolls normally and the real column's height depends on how many
 *   results came back. It is the cheap, reliable half of the guarantee:
 *   whatever else differs, the footer cannot ride up. It is deliberately NOT
 *   applied at desktop — there the body is already a definite `100svh` and
 *   this `<main>` is the flex child that takes whatever the masthead leaves,
 *   so forcing a full viewport onto it would overflow the body by the height
 *   of the masthead and put the window straight back into scrolling.
 *
 * Everything inside is static markup wearing the real page's class names, not
 * the real components. `SearchBand`, `FilterBar` and `MapPanel` are all
 * `'use client'`, and `MapPanel` pulls in pigeon-maps and starts fetching map
 * tiles — work thrown away milliseconds later by the swap. Nothing here is
 * interactive for the same reason: a search field a visitor can type into is a
 * field whose keystrokes vanish when Suspense resolves.
 *
 * Placeholders follow the house pattern from /groups — `animate-pulse` over
 * `bg-pana-ink/10` blocks sized like the content they stand in for, wrapped in
 * `aria-hidden` so none of it is announced. The one exception is the results
 * list, which uses `.dirsearch-skeleton`: that is the idiom the live page
 * already shows between searches, so the hand-off from this shell to the
 * page's own loading state has nothing to see.
