/**
 * The top of the directory view.
 *
 * The directory is now the only thing this band sits on top of. It used to be
 * shared with four scope pages — Everything, Panas, Groups, Events all
 * rendered it — and the shape it has is still owed to that: a tall indigo
 * band with the term as a headline, because a compact white toolbar and a
 * tall band on the same search made the site look like two products depending
 * on which URL you arrived through. The scope pages are gone, each kind now
 * having a page built for it, but the band stays because it is the better of
 * the two and the rest of the club now matches it.
 *
 * The cost is real and was accepted deliberately. This page does not scroll —
 * the map holds the right half and the list scrolls inside its own pane — so
 * every pixel spent here is a pixel taken from results rather than from empty
 * space. The counter-argument was that this makes a band the wrong shape for
 * a page you refine five times in a row. That argument lost to consistency: a
 * member who cannot tell whether they are still in the same product is a
 * worse outcome than a member who sees three results instead of four before
 * scrolling.
 *
 * Four things must keep surviving any future edit here:
 *
 * - The count is `role="status"`. It changes client-side, so it has to
 *   announce rather than silently rewrite itself.
 * - Submitting runs `onSearch` rather than navigating. The filters, sort and
 *   map view live in this page's query string and a route push would drop
 *   them.
 * - The location bar stays. It is the one control that turns a list of
 *   listings into a list you can get to, and it has no equivalent on the
 *   other three pages because only directory listings have addresses to
 *   measure from.
 * - The scope menu stays, in link mode. The directory holds one kind now, so
 *   the menu is no longer a filter over this page's results — it is the way
 *   out to the other three, carrying the term you already typed. Someone who
 *   searched "cumbia" and got listings should be one click from the events.
 *
 * "Listings" rather than "businesses" throughout, which is not a synonym
 * swap: a directory account can be claimed by a band, a co-op or a non-profit
 * as well as a shop, and calling all of them businesses told a good share of
 * the people in here that the page was not for them.
