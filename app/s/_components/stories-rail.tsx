/* The stories strip above the composer.
 *
 * Deliberately not an Instagram tray. Stories here are watched by tapping a
 * pana's face, and this is the one place on the product where the faces worth
 * tapping can be gathered in advance -- everywhere else a ring is incidental
 * to a row that exists for another reason. It shows the viewer's own circle
 * first, then only the panas they follow who actually have something to watch.
 *
 * Which panas those are is decided here rather than by the rings. StoryRing
 * renders a plain avatar when there is nothing to watch, so handing it every
 * followed account would draw a strip of faces that are mostly not stories --
 * the opposite of what the strip is for. The batched summary answers that in
 * one request (lib/social/story-summary-client.ts), and because the answer is
 * cached for a minute the rings then mount against a warm cache instead of
 * asking again.
