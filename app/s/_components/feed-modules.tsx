/* Modules injected between posts.
 *
 * The feed without these is a single column of statuses and nothing else,
 * which is why it collapses to a grey box the moment the people you follow go
 * quiet. These carry the surface on a slow day and give a new account
 * something to act on before it has followed anybody.
 *
 * All three of the mock's modules are here now. "Panas you might know" was
 * held back originally because a suggestion list needs a reason beside each
 * name and nothing produced one; listSuggestedActors does, by walking mutual
 * follows, so the module has the thing it was missing.
 *
 * Both modules render nothing at all when they have no rows. A module that
 * degrades to a heading above an empty strip is worse than an absent one,
 * because it reads as breakage rather than as quiet.
 *
 * Images are plain <img> rather than next/image on purpose: these are remote
 * CDN URLs and next.config.js declares no remotePatterns, so the optimizer
 * rejects them at runtime. This matches the homepage and the directory card.
