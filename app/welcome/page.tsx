/**
 * The first page a brand-new member sees after their first sign-in.
 *
 * It exists because signing up and signing in are the same exchange here: a
 * magic link authenticates an email and nothing else, so a first-time member
 * arrives with a `users` row and no profile — able to read, silently unable to
 * post or follow. This page is where that half-state gets resolved, by asking
 * the one question that creates a profile.
 *
 * Deliberately an interstitial and not a wizard: one page, one required answer,
 * and a skip that says what it costs. See docs/ONBOARDING-ROADMAP.md.
