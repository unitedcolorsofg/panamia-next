/**
 * Tests for the sign-in redirect URL builder.
 *
 * `callbackUrl` is a query parameter whose value is itself a URL, which is the
 * kind of nesting that looks fine until a destination carries its own query
 * string. These pages used to build the URL by hand, and the hand-built
 * version interpolated the path raw:
 *
 *     `/signin?callbackUrl=/m/schedule/book?mentor=${handle}`
 *
 * A reader sees one parameter. A URL parser sees two, because the second `?`
 * is just a character and `mentor` becomes a sibling of `callbackUrl` rather
 * than part of it. The member then lands on a booking form with no mentor,
 * which refuses to submit and cannot say why.
 *
 * So the assertions below are mostly about separators surviving the round
 * trip. Parsing the result rather than string-matching it is deliberate: the
 * bug being pinned is precisely that a parser disagrees with the eye.
 *
 * No session, no router, no network — `signInPath` takes a string.
