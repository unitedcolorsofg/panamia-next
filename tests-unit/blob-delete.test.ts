/**
 * Tests for batched R2 deletion.
 *
 * These pin two things the nightly purge depends on and that nothing else
 * would catch:
 *
 *  - the 1000-key ceiling on R2's `delete()`. Exceeding it fails the call,
 *    and the caller that would trip it is a cleanup job whose failure mode is
 *    silent: media stays in the bucket and keeps being billed.
 *  - which URLs count as ours. Getting this wrong in the permissive direction
 *    means slicing a key out of a host we do not control; in the strict
 *    direction it means never reclaiming our own storage.
 *
 * No network: the R2 binding is a local fake. `R2_PUBLIC_URL` is read when
 * lib/blob/api.ts is first evaluated, so the import is deferred until after
 * the environment is set.
