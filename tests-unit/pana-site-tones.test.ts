/**
 * Tests that the account menu's tile colours are still derived, not copied.
 *
 * The account menu tints six of its nine destination discs so that a noun
 * reads the same colour there as it does in the search scope bar. The colour
 * itself is not interesting; where it comes from is. Each one is read out of
 * `SCOPE_TONE` (lib/directory-scopes.ts) or `SURFACE_TONE`
 * (lib/panaverse/branding.ts), so recolouring a scope upstream recolours the
 * tile with no second edit.
 *
 * That is the whole point of these assertions, and it is why they compare
 * against the canonical maps rather than against the strings those maps
 * currently hold. `assert.equal(events.tone, 'pink')` would pass today and
 * keep passing on the day somebody recoloured the event scope and left the
 * tile behind — which is precisely the failure this repo has shipped twice.
 * `ScopeMenu` grew a private copy of the members-only rule (#309), and
 * `getSuggestions` grew a second one that had drifted by the time it was
 * found (#314). Both survived review because a duplicate that agrees with
 * its original is invisible until it stops agreeing. Comparing to the source
 * is the only version of this test that fails on the drift rather than on the
 * colour.
 *
 * No database, no network, no React: the registry is plain data.
