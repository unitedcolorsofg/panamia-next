/**
 * Tests for the Permissions-Policy response header.
 *
 * This header is one string, set in one place, and a single character in it is
 * the difference between a working feature and a dead button. `geolocation=()`
 * is not "restrict geolocation" — an empty allowlist denies the API to *every*
 * origin, the document's own included, so `getCurrentPosition()` rejects with
 * PERMISSION_DENIED before the browser ever offers its prompt. That shipped,
 * and the directory's "Use my location" control failed closed into its
 * permission-denied branch for every visitor. Nothing threw, nothing logged,
 * and the UI's own copy ("Location is off") made it read like a user choice.
 *
 * So these assert the allowlist *value*, not merely the directive's presence.
 * A test that only checked `includes('geolocation')` would have passed against
 * the broken header. The paired negative assertion is the whole point: it is
 * the one that fails if someone tightens `(self)` back to `()`.
 *
 * No network and no database — `proxy()` builds a response from a request.
