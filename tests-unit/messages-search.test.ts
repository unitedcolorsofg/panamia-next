/**
 * Tests for the Messages search box.
 *
 * The box shipped as a div wrapping a span: a pill with a magnifier and
 * placeholder-grey label reading "Search messages", promoted verbatim from
 * the mock it was designed in. It had the exact silhouette of a search field
 * and could not be focused or typed into, so the only way to discover it was
 * decorative was to try to use it -- which is how it was reported, as "the
 * send messages text box isnt working".
 *
 * Two things are guarded here.
 *
 * The behaviour, as pure functions, because the box answers two questions at
 * once -- which of my threads is this, and who else could I write to -- and
 * the exclusions in the second are the part that silently rots. A row
 * offering a conversation with yourself looks perfectly reasonable in review
 * and dead-ends on a 404 the moment anyone clicks it.
 *
 * The markup, at source level, because no pure test can tell an <input> from
 * a <span> that looks like one, and that distinction was the entire bug.
