/**
 * Tests that every masthead a signed-in member can live under mounts the
 * account controls.
 *
 * Pana Social has more than one masthead, and that is the whole bug. The
 * notifications bell was added to `MainHeader`, which flies over the main
 * site — but a member on social.pana.social is under
 * `SurfaceMemberHeader`, the masthead a surface wears over its own rooms.
 * The bell was never added there, so on the feed, the page members use most,
 * there was no bell at all. And because chat shipped with its only entry
 * point inside the bell's panel, there was no route to /messages either: the
 * feature was unreachable from the one surface built to use it. The first
 * thing asked about it was "where do I send messages?".
 *
 * No type and no render test would have caught that, because each masthead
 * is correct in isolation. What was wrong was that the *set* of mastheads
 * had grown and the controls had not — a fact about which component mounts
 * which, invisible to anything that looks at one file at a time. So this
 * asserts over the set: a third masthead has to be added here, and adding it
 * means carrying the controls.
 *
 * `SurfaceGuestHeader` is deliberately not in the list. It is the slim bar a
 * surface wears over a page it has *borrowed* from another surface, where
 * the job is a route back rather than a full account rail. If it ever grows
 * into a masthead members live under, it belongs here.
 *
 * Source-level for the same reason `pana-site-tones` is: the claim is about
 * what a file mounts. No database, no network, no React renderer.
