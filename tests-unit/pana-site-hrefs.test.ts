/**
 * Tests that a tile crossing a surface boundary keeps the path that surface
 * actually lives at.
 *
 * `resolvePanaSites` rewrites each registry tile against the host being
 * served. For a tile that points at a surface's *root* it also decides whether
 * to name the prefix or a bare "/", because a surface's front door wears a
 * different URL depending on where you are standing: social.pana.social/ and
 * pana.social/s are the same feed, and only the first is the one a member
 * would repeat out loud.
 *
 * The rule that was wrong, and the reason this file exists: crossing origins
 * used to assume "/". That holds for a surface with its own subdomain, since
 * arriving on social.pana.social puts you at the feed by construction. It is
 * false for a surface with `subdomain: null`, which is served from the shared
 * root domain — whose "/" belongs to the main site. Events is path-only (see
 * the SURFACES entry, which explains why), so the account menu on
 * admin.pana.social and social.pana.social sent every reader to the homepage
 * instead of to the calendar. The surface was reachable the whole time; the
 * only broken thing was the link.
 *
 * These assertions are written against the registry rather than against the
 * strings it currently holds, for the reason pana-site-tones.test.ts sets out
 * at length: a test that hardcodes "/e" passes on the day somebody gives
 * Events a subdomain and silently stops testing the rule. Giving a surface a
 * subdomain, or taking one away, should flip these expectations on its own.
 *
 * No database, no network, no React: the registry is plain data.
