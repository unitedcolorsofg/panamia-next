/**
 * The scheduled-job ledger: one row per run, so "did the machinery work" has
 * an answer that outlives a console log.
 *
 * ## This module is not allowed to break the job it records
 *
 * Every function here swallows its own failures. That is deliberate and it is
 * the most important thing about this file.
 *
 * The hourly purge is real work -- it reclaims R2 objects that nothing else
 * reclaims. Recording that it happened is bookkeeping. If the bookkeeping
 * throws and takes the purge with it, this module has made the system worse
 * in exchange for observing it, which is the one outcome worth engineering
 * against.
 *
 * This is not hypothetical caution. Migrations have twice reached production
 * unapplied in this repo (see scripts/check-pending-migrations.ts, which
 * exists because of it). If 0063 lands late, every call here hits a table
 * that does not exist. Swallowing means the sweep carries on untouched and
 * /admin/livesite says "not migrated yet"; not swallowing would mean the
 * deploy silently stops the only thing keeping the bucket from growing
 * forever.
 *
 * So: failures go to console.error, tagged, and nothing propagates. A missing
 * ledger row is a gap in a dashboard. A missing purge is a bill.
 *
 * ## Why a row is written at the start
 *
 * A run that dies mid-flight -- CPU budget exceeded, isolate evicted, deploy
 * landing on top of it -- never executes its own epilogue. If rows were only
 * written on completion, that case would look exactly like "the cron never
 * fired", and those two need different people to fix them.
 *
 * Writing at the start costs one extra statement an hour and makes the
 * distinction permanent: `finished_at IS NULL` on an old row is a run that
 * was killed.
