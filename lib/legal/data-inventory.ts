// Binds the privacy framework to the database schema.
//
// policy.json describes what we collect; this file asserts that description
// against the actual Drizzle tables. Historically nothing connected the two, so
// design drift went unnoticed in both directions — categories documenting
// dropped tables (event_photos, srt_keys) and tables holding personal data with
// no category at all (the relay tables). See docs/PRIVACY-ROADMAP.md.
//
// Two guarantees, at two layers:
//
//  - Compile time: `inventory` is Record<TableExport, Classification>, where
//    TableExport is every table exported from lib/schema. Adding a table to the
//    schema without an entry here is a compile error — the decision lands when
//    the table is written, which is when the author knows the answer.
//
//  - Run time: category NAMES cannot be checked at compile time — they widen to
//    `string` coming through the policy.json import — so validateInventory()
//    checks that every referenced category exists and that every category is
//    either table-backed or declared storage-free. scripts/check-data-inventory.ts
//    runs it in pre-commit.
//
// Granularity is table-level, not column-level: `profiles` backs six categories,
// so this catches "table undocumented" but not "new personal column added to an
// already-classified table". Column-level is a heavier v2.
