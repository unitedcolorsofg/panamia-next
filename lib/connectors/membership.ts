/**
 * Connectors programme membership, as stored on `profiles.connector`.
 *
 * This is the real thing that replaced the fixture roster. The surface
 * originally shipped as a mock: a hardcoded demo connector was shown to
 * everybody, so a signed-in member was greeted by somebody else's name. The
 * column added in drizzle/0055_profile_connector.sql is what this module
 * reads and writes.
 *
 * ## Why parse rather than cast
 *
 * The sibling blobs on `profiles` are read with a straight `as` cast (see
 * `app/m/profile/page.tsx` doing `profile.mentoring as ProfileMentoring`).
 * That is fine when the only writer is a form you control and the only reader
 * renders a string. It is not fine here, because this blob decides programme
 * state: which houses you are in and what tier you are shown at.
 *
 * A cast asserts a shape that nothing checks. Anything already in the column —
 * written by an older build, hand-edited during support, or restored from a
 * backup taken before a shape change — would flow straight into the page and
 * fail somewhere further away, as a blank house pill or a crash in `getHouse`.
 * `parseConnector` instead returns `null` for anything it does not recognise,
 * so a malformed blob degrades to "not a connector yet" — a state the UI
 * already handles and the member can fix by joining again.
 *
 * It also drops unknown houses rather than rejecting the whole record, which
 * is what lets a house be retired from `HOUSES` without stranding every member
 * who had picked it.
 *
 * ## Why there is a status
 *
 * Applying is not joining. The programme accepts people rather than letting
 * anyone who finds the URL award themselves a place, so a record exists from
 * the moment somebody applies and only counts as membership once staff have
 * said yes. This mirrors `venues.status`, which goes `pending_review` →
 * `active` through `app/api/admin/venues/[slug]/approve/route.ts`.
 *
 * The status lives inside this blob rather than in a new column, so adding the
 * gate needed no migration — 0055 already shipped the column, and a jsonb
 * value has no shape for the database to disagree with.
