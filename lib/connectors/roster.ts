/**
 * The programme's view of itself: who is in it, and how they are spread.
 *
 * `membership.ts` answers "what is this one person's record". This answers
 * "what does the programme look like", which is a different question with a
 * different shape — aggregates, rosters, and the writes only staff can make.
 *
 * ## There is no such thing as an unassigned connector
 *
 * The mock's console had an "Assign a house" panel listing people who had
 * joined without picking one. That state cannot occur: `parseConnector`
 * returns `null` for a record with no recognised house, so a house-less
 * membership is not a connector with a gap — it is not a connector at all,
 * and HQ already routes those people back to the join form.
 *
 * So assignment is not filling in a blank. It is *moving* somebody: adding a
 * second house when they start doing that work too, or correcting one picked
 * in haste at signup. The console reflects that — it edits the whole roster
 * rather than offering a queue of the unassigned that would always be empty.
 *
 * ## Why the tallies are counted in JavaScript
 *
 * Houses are an array inside a JSONB blob, so counting them in SQL means
 * `jsonb_array_elements` and a lateral join, and the result still has to be
 * reconciled with `parseConnector`'s rules about which houses count — a
 * retired house is dropped from a membership by the parser but would still be
 * counted by the database.
 *
 * One query that reads every active member and tallies in memory keeps a
 * single definition of what a house membership is. The programme is tens of
 * people; the day it is thousands, this becomes a materialised count and the
 * parser's rules move into the migration that builds it.
