/**
 * Commitments: what a connector is actually doing.
 *
 * These used to live inside `profiles.connector`. drizzle/0056 moved them out
 * because the admin console can now set a task for somebody, and the blob was
 * only ever safe while each row had exactly one writer. The old route said so
 * itself — "if a second writer ever appears, this needs to move to its own
 * table rather than grow a lock" — and this is that move.
 *
 * ## One row type, two origins
 *
 * A task staff put on your board and a commitment you made yourself are the
 * same thing to everyone downstream: something you are going to do, in a
 * house, by roughly when, at some stage of done. They differ only in who
 * asked, which is one nullable column rather than a second table.
 *
 * `assignedBy === null` means you wrote it. That is the common case, so it is
 * the cheap one to store.
 *
 * ## Who may do what
 *
 * Progress is the connector's, always. Staff can put something on your board;
 * they cannot tick it off for you, because the only person who knows whether
 * the zines got dropped off is the person who did or did not drop them off.
 *
 * Deletion splits the other way. You may delete what you wrote — changing
 * your mind about your own commitment is the point of having one. You may not
 * delete what staff assigned you, because a task you can remove is a task you
 * were never really given, and the programme would have no way to tell "done"
 * from "gone". Declining an assignment is a conversation, and it leaves the
 * row visible until somebody has it.
