/**
 * The Community Connectors programme, as data.
 *
 * Four houses, three tiers, three pods. All of it comes from the programme
 * deck rather than from anybody's guess, so the names here are the names a
 * connector has already seen on a slide.
 *
 * ## Why four houses and not five
 *
 * The Connector Dashboard sheet grew a fifth house, "World Building", at some
 * point after the deck was written. It is not in the deck, nobody is assigned
 * to it in the programme materials, and the panas confirmed it was a mistake
 * in the sheet rather than a house anyone agreed to add. So it is absent here
 * on purpose: this file is the source of truth, and the sheet is the thing
 * that has to come back into line.
 *
 * If a fifth house is ever genuinely agreed, it is one entry in `HOUSES` plus
 * a colour — nothing else in the app enumerates them.
 *
 * Dependency-free like `lib/panaverse/*`, so a server route and a client
 * component can both read it without dragging React anywhere.

   *   indigo/cream 9.01   burnt/ink 5.29   blue/ink 8.21   pink/ink 5.13
