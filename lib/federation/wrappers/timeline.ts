 * the request row persists, so the caller must render a sender with an empty
 * thread rather than treating it as an error.

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * DM conversations
 *
 * The inbox and sent queries above answer "what was addressed to me" and "what
 * did I send". Neither is a conversation: both are flat, both are ordered
 * newest-first, and neither puts the two halves of an exchange together. These
 * two functions are the read side of the DM chat view, which docs/CHAT-ROADMAP
 * records as the prerequisite for live delivery.
 *
 * WHY ONE-TO-ONE ONLY
 *
 * A direct status carries up to eight recipient URIs, so "the conversation
 * with Bee" is not well defined for a message also addressed to six other
 * people. Grouping such a message under each recipient separately is the
 * tempting read, and it is a safety bug: the reply box under it would address
 * one person while the message above it went to seven, so a reply silently
 * narrows an audience the sender believed they were still talking to.
 *
 * So a conversation here is exactly two participants, enforced in SQL by
 * `oneToOneDirect()` rather than assumed. Multi-recipient DMs stay readable in
 * the /updates lists, which make no claim to be a thread. Nothing creates a
 * multi-recipient DM in the product today; this guard is what keeps that from
 * silently becoming a bug if something ever does.
 *
 * Note that the one-to-one test is on `recipientTo` length rather than on a
 * count of participants, which is correct because createStatus writes `cc: []`
 * for direct visibility -- see the 'direct' branch of ./status.ts.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
