/**
 * Acting on a group's membership.
 *
 * The write half of the roster. `group-members.ts` answers who is in a group;
 * this decides who gets in, who runs it, and who is shown the door.
 *
 * Every function here takes the actor doing the acting, not just the target,
 * because every rule in this file is about the relationship between the two.
 * "Can this be done" is never a property of the target alone -- removing a
 * member is fine, removing the last admin is not, and a moderator removing
 * another moderator is a fight rather than moderation.
 *
 * The three invariants, each enforced in exactly one place below:
 *
 *  1. A group always keeps at least one active admin. A group without one can
 *     never approve a request, change a setting, or be deleted -- it is
 *     stranded, and nothing in the product can rescue it.
 *  2. A moderator may only act on plain members. Role changes are admin-only
 *     because they decide who runs the group, which is the same reason
 *     editing the group is admin-only.
 *  3. member_count counts active rows and nothing else. Every transition here
 *     either changes a row's active-ness or does not, and the count follows
 *     that one fact rather than being recomputed per action.
 *
 * @see lib/federation/wrappers/group-members.ts  the read half
 * @see docs/GROUPS-ROADMAP.md
