  // hit 100+ followers across many hosts, which blows the CF Workers request
  // budget and has no retry story if a remote server is flaky.
  //
  // Plan: introduce a `FederationDelivery` Durable Object keyed by remote
  // host (e.g. `mastodon.social`). After this update commits, enqueue one
  // job per unique destination host containing the activity + target inbox
  // URLs. The DO owns:
  //   - persistent queue in DO storage (survives request termination)
  //   - alarm-based exponential backoff retries
  //   - per-host request coalescing + rate limiting
  //   - dead-letter handling
  //
  // CF Queues is a simpler alternative but loses per-host state
  // (ordering, coalescing, connection reuse), which matters for ActivityPub
  // Create→Delete races and for being a good citizen to remote instances.
  //
  // The same DO should also be used from inbox-handler.ts for sending
  // Accept activities (currently fire-and-forget with only console.error
  // on failure — see inbox-handler.ts:~154).

  // DEFERRED: Realtime timeline broadcast.
  //
  // When Pusher was removed, the "new post appears live in followers' feeds"
  // UX regressed. There is no replacement yet; /s relies on manual refresh.
  //
  // Plan: reuse the WebSocket + Durable Object hibernation pattern already
  // implemented in worker/signaling-room.ts for WebRTC signaling. A
  // `TimelineFeed` DO per public-timeline-shard (and optionally per-user for
  // the home timeline) holds the set of connected WebSocket clients; after
  // this DB commit, publish the new status to the relevant DO(s) and they
  // push it down to subscribers. React Query on the client merges it into
  // the existing timeline cache.
  //
  // Note: fan-out on READ (see getHomeTimeline in ./timeline.ts) is the
  // correct design and should be kept — a DO-backed materialized timeline
  // is NOT the goal here. This is purely a live push channel on top of the
