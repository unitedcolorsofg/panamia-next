// Stories: ephemeral, image-or-video posts watched from a pana's profile
// picture rather than scrolled in a feed.
//
// A story is a row in social_statuses with type = 'Story'. It is not a
// separate table, because the two genuinely hard parts of a story were
// already built and proven here:
//
//   - expiry. social_statuses.expiresAt has existed since the first migration
//     and every read path already honours it (see notExpired() in
//     ./timeline.ts). Direct messages have relied on it for their 7-day life
//     since day one. A parallel stories table would have had to re-derive
//     that, and re-derive it correctly in six query sites.
//
//   - attachments. social_attachments already carries R2 image and video URLs,
//     already has an upload path in /api/social/media, and is already rendered
//     by the post components. Story media is the same media.
//
// The price of that reuse is paid in ./timeline.ts: every query that means
// "posts" now has to say so explicitly via excludeStories(). That cost is real
// but it is one guard in one file, against duplicating expiry and media
// handling in two places that would drift.
//
// What is deliberately NOT reused: visibility. Stories are addressed
// followers-only (recipientTo = [followersUrl]) even though anyone who opens
// the profile can watch them. Addressing here is not the access control -- it
// is the federation blocker. The outbox selects on recipientTo containing the
// Public URI, so a followers-only story physically cannot leave this server.
// That matters because Mastodon has no story concept: a federated story lands
// on a remote instance as an ordinary post that never expires, and the 24-hour
// promise made to the author silently does not apply to the copy.
