/**
 * Active profile ("act as") resolution.
 *
 * One login can administer several profiles: the person's own, plus any
 * business listings they have claimed. This module answers "which one are they
 * acting as right now?" for server code.
 *
 * The selection lives in a cookie, which is client-controlled and therefore
 * never trusted. Every read re-validates the id against profile_owners before
 * returning it, so forging the cookie gets you nothing — a mismatch silently
 * falls back to the user's own profile rather than erroring, because a stale
 * cookie (access revoked, listing deleted) is expected, not exceptional.
