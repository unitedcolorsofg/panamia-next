/**
 * The one place a directory listing is approved or declined.
 *
 * ## Why this is a library and not a route
 *
 * There are two doors into this decision and there always will be. Staff
 * approve listings by clicking a link in an email — routinely on a phone that
 * is not signed in — which is why `/api/admin/profile/action` authenticates
 * with a capability key instead of a session and why `app/admin/layout.tsx`
 * cannot carry a server-side gate. The admin queue is the second door, and it
 * authenticates with a session.
 *
 * Both doors have to perform the *same* write: flip `active`, stamp `status`,
 * and mail the business owner exactly once. Writing that twice would mean two
 * implementations of "publish a business to the public directory" drifting
 * apart, and the way you would find out is a business being told it was
 * approved by one path and still not appearing in the directory.
 *
 * So the routes keep their own authentication — which is genuinely different
 * between them — and share this.
 *
 * ## `expect`
 *
 * The capability link passes `'any'`, which is the behaviour it has always
 * had: the link in a decline email still works after an approve, because
 * reversing a decision is a real thing staff do and the email is sometimes the
 * only artefact they still have.
 *
 * The admin queue passes `'pending'`. The queue only ever renders undecided
 * rows, so a decision arriving for a decided row means the page was stale —
 * someone else got there first, or a button was double-clicked. Refusing it
 * is what stops a second click from re-stamping a decision and, worse, from
 * quietly overturning a colleague's.
 *
 * ## The email is sent once, by first stamp
 *
 * `profile.published` fires only when `status.approved` was previously unset,
 * and the decline mail likewise. This is the pre-existing rule and it is load
 * bearing: without it, a reviewer re-opening an old approval email and
 * clicking through would mail the business a second "you're live!" months
 * later.

 * the column wholesale, so anything not spread forward is destroyed.
