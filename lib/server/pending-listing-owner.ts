/**
 * Listings that *say* a given person should run them, pending their answer.
 *
 * The public intake form optionally collects a personal address alongside the
 * business one, so a submitter can be handed the listing they just created
 * instead of waiting on a claim email sent to a shared shop inbox. There is no
 * account to attach it to at that moment — intake is unauthenticated by design
 * — so the address is parked on profiles.pending_owner_email.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS IS AN INVITATION AND NOT AN AUTOMATIC GRANT
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * pending_owner_email is written by a PUBLIC, UNAUTHENTICATED form, which
 * means it is attacker-controlled. Redeeming it automatically at sign-in would
 * mean: submit a listing naming victim@example.com, wait for that person to
 * sign in next week for reasons of their own, and they silently become owner
 * of record for a business they have never heard of. Admin review still gates
 * publication, but a plausible-looking listing that gets approved leaves a
 * stranger holding it.
 *
 * That is precisely the hole notBusinessListing already closes in
 * claimProfileForUser (lib/server/profile-owners.ts). profiles.email is
 * attacker-supplied through the same form, and excluding intake rows from
 * implicit auto-claim is what defuses it: the auto-absorb path is safe only
 * because what remains is admin-imported and legacy rows that no anonymous
 * person can write. Redeeming a second attacker-writable column at sign-in
 * would reopen the same hole through a different door.
 *
 * So nothing here is granted implicitly. The member is asked, by name, whether
 * a listing is theirs, and ownership moves only on an affirmative click. That
 * also reads better in the honest case: an owner handed a listing with no
 * explanation is confused; one asked "is this yours?" is oriented.
 *
 * What the answer proves, and what it does not:
 *   - Confirming proves control of the personal inbox — the same proof the
 *     explicit claim flow uses, pointed at a different address.
 *   - It proves NOTHING about whether the business is theirs. Nothing here
 *     publishes: intake lands listings active = false and the existing admin
 *     approve/decline gate is untouched. Owning an unpublished listing is
 *     harmless, and it is what gives the submitter an "under review" view
 *     instead of silence.
