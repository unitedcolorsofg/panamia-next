/**
 * Why every comparison below is wrapped in pana_unaccent().
 *
 * ILIKE folds case but not diacritics, so `'Taller Lucía' ILIKE '%lucia%'` is
 * false. A member typing on a US keyboard — which is most of them, most of the
 * time — got an empty typeahead for any business whose name carries an accent,
 * while pressing Enter found it, because getSearch() unaccents both sides.
 * Miami's directory is full of these: Café, Bodegón, Peluquería, Lucía, José.
 *
 * Unaccenting both sides rather than just the column is deliberate, and is
 * what getSearch() does. Column-only would fix "lucia" -> "Lucía" but break
 * the mirror case, where someone typing "Lucía" on a Spanish keyboard or a
 * phone misses a listing stored without the accent.
 *
 * It also aligns the profile name predicate with the index built for this very
 * query shape: 0041_profile_name_trigram.sql creates a GIN gin_trgm_ops index
 * on pana_unaccent(name) so an `ILIKE '%term%'` on a name can use it, and that
 * migration warns the query must filter on the same expression the index
 * stores or the index is dead weight. The bare column could never have.
 *
 * Measured rather than assumed, and the alignment alone does not buy the
 * scan. Given the name predicate on its own the planner does choose
 * profiles_name_trgm_idx (confirmed with enable_seqscan=off; on a small table
 * it costs out a seq scan first). In the OR'd shape the business query
 * actually issues it bitmap-scans profiles_active_idx and applies all three
 * ILIKEs as a filter, because the two jsonb expressions have no index to OR
 * against. So this makes the name predicate indexable, not indexed. That is
 * worth having as the table grows, or if those jsonb columns are ever indexed,
 * but it is not a performance fix today and shouldn't be cited as one.
 *
 * The events and groups tables have no trigram index, and deliberately get
 * none here: both are small enough that a sequential scan of a name column
 * costs less than the write amplification an index would add. Revisit if
 * either grows by an order of magnitude.
 *
 * That still holds, but it is no longer the whole story: 0044 gave both tables
 * a tsvector and a GIN index anyway. Not for speed -- on these row counts the
 * seq scan above is still the cheaper plan, and this suggest query keeps using
 * ILIKE. It was added because the scoped results pages behind this typeahead
 * match on phrases rather than prefixes, and substring matching answers those
 * badly. Two different queries with two different jobs, deliberately using two
 * different mechanisms. See 0044's header before collapsing them.
 *
 * pana_unaccent is STRICT, so a null `about` or description still yields null
 * and is still excluded, exactly as the bare column was. It is also IMMUTABLE
 * (0040) — the wrapper exists because unaccent() itself is only STABLE.

 * is where they meet, and is the only thing here permitted to decide which
 * kinds run -- so a signed-out `?scope=pana` comes back empty rather than
 * coming back with panas.
 *
 * WHY A SCOPE NARROWS TO ONE KIND, since the opposite was deliberate.
 *
 * This started as a federated box: no scope control existed, so every search
 * asked all four kinds and `mergeSuggestions` round-robined them into one
 * list. That was the right design for a "jump to anything" field and the
 * round-robin below is still written for it.
 *
 * The scope control was then built around this box without ever being wired
 * into it, which left the two disagreeing in public: picking Events and typing
 * "music" returned directory listings, under a chip reading Events, above a
 * row offering to search the directory. The control named one kind and the
 * list ignored it.
 *
 * So the scope now selects, and the cost is accepted rather than unnoticed:
 * Events with no matches shows an empty list where it used to show businesses.
 * The alternative on the table was falling back to the other kinds when a
 * scope came up empty, and it was rejected -- a list that silently changes
 * subject is the original bug wearing a better excuse. The box searches
 * exactly what the control says, including when the answer is nothing.
 *
 * An absent scope keeps the federated behaviour, and that is not nostalgia:
 * clients running the previous bundle send no scope, and they go on working
 * for as long as they are out there.
 *
 * WHY GROUPS ARE NO LONGER GATED HERE, which is a visible change.
 *
 * This function used to substitute an empty list for groups as well as panas
 * when the viewer was signed out. That was a second copy of an access rule,
 * and it had drifted from the one `visibleScopes` keeps: `SCOPE_REQUIRES_PANA`
 * marks only panas members-only, and `GET /api/social/groups` is deliberately
 * unauthenticated, serving these same identity-only rows -- private groups
 * included -- through this same `searchGroups`, so that a group with an open
 * request policy can be found by the people meant to ask to join it.
 *
 * So the gate was not protecting the data; the same rows were already a public
 * endpoint away. What it did do was leave a signed-out visitor who picked
 * Groups -- a scope the menu offers them, because `visibleScopes` says it is
 * public -- staring at a dropdown that could never fill. Deleting it is what
 * removing the duplicate means, and it settles that disagreement the way the
 * canonical rule already answered it. Panas stay gated, and are the only kind
 * that is.
