/**
 * How well a profile answers the search term, according to Postgres.

 * handing the question to the database:
 *
 *   - the query was one opaque string, so "kitchen bohemian" found nothing
 *     while "bohemian kitchen" worked
 *   - nothing was stemmed, so "foods" found nothing while "food" worked
 *   - nothing was accent-folded, so Sazon and Sazón were different businesses
 *
 * The query is OR'd across three text-search configurations. English and
 * Spanish because the community writes in both and one stemmer would serve
 * half of it worse than the other half; `simple` because it is the only arm
 * that survives a query made *entirely* of stop words. Searching "the" alone
 * reduces the stemmed arms to an empty tsquery, which matches nothing, so a
 * business named "The Hall" would be unreachable by its own first word. Note
 * this really does need the whole query to be stop words -- "the hall" is
 * fine without the simple arm, because "hall" survives stemming. Do not
 * delete the arm after testing a query that still has one real word in it.
 *
 * `ts_rank_cd` handles relevance from the column weights set in migration
 * 0040, but it has no concept of "this *is* the business you named". The two
 * boosts below restore the top of the old ladder, which encoded a real
 * product rule: someone typing a business name exactly should get that
 * business first, not fourth behind three listings that mention it.

/**
 * Trigram fallback, for when full-text search finds nothing.
 *
 * Every arm of the query above is exact-match-after-stemming, so one wrong
 * letter is indistinguishable from a word that isn't there: "bohemain" finds
 * nothing at all. That is the worst possible answer, because a typo is
 * invisible to the person who made it -- the directory looks empty rather
 * than misspelled.
 *
 * This runs only when the text search returned zero rows. Firing on empty
 * rather than on "too few" keeps fuzzy matches from polluting queries that
 * already work, costs nothing on the happy path, and means the two result
 * sets never mix, so there is no ranking conflict to reconcile.
 *
 * Three details here are load-bearing and none of them are visible in review:
 *
 *   - word_similarity(), not similarity(). similarity() compares the whole
 *     column, so a short query against a multi-word name is diluted by the
 *     words it didn't mention: "kitchn" scores 0.26 against "Bohemian
 *     Kitchen" and is missed at every usable threshold, while
 *     word_similarity scores 0.71. Measured, not assumed.
 *   - the %> operator, not word_similarity(...) >= n. Only the operator can
 *     use the GIN index; the function form is a sequential scan. At 20k rows
 *     that is 0.09ms against 49ms, and the two read almost identically.
 *   - `pana_unaccent(p.name)` on the left of %>, matching the indexed
 *     expression exactly, or the index is skipped.
 *
 * The threshold is 0.5 rather than pg_trgm's default 0.6 because 0.6 drops
 * real typos: "bisayne yoga" -> "Biscayne Bay Yoga" scores 0.58. Re-measured
 * against a 20k-name corpus, 0.6 loses "bohemain" and "bisayne yoga"
 * outright, so the cost of the default is a silent miss rather than a wrong
 * match. 0.5 held up; it was calibrated on 15 rows and survived 20k.
 *
 * What does degrade at scale is precision, and it tracks how many businesses
 * share the misspelled word rather than the size of the table. A distinctive
 * word still lands the target near the top: "wynwod print" is 2nd of 12.
 * A generic one buries it: "kitchn" is 34th of 375, because word_similarity
 * scores every "<something> Kitchen" name identically and the tiebreak is
 * then arbitrary. That is tolerable, because it returns the same set the
 * corrected spelling would have -- the failure mode is a broad list, not a
 * confident wrong answer. Reordering does not rescue it: ranking by
 * whole-string similarity, or by shortest name, was measured and moves the
 * generic case further down (34th -> 69th) while only helping cases that
 * already worked.

/**
 * How deep the term arm reads before it stops caring.
 *
 * Without a bound this query returns every row whose search_vector matches at
 * all, and a common word matches a large fraction of the directory. Those ids
 * then become an IN list on the row fetch below, so a one-word search would
 * ship thousands of ids to Postgres and pull thousands of full rows back to
 * pick twenty. The cost scales with how generic the word is, which is exactly
 * backwards — the vaguest searches paid the most.
 *
 * The cut is by final score, boosts included, so the listing somebody named
 * exactly is never the row that falls off the end. 500 is well past where
 * relevance ordering still means anything: nobody pages to result 480, and
 * anything below that is matching on a single low-weight token.
 *
 * The trade-off is real and worth stating. Category, county, certification and
 * mentoring filters run in memory after this, so a filter that only matches
 * listings ranked below 500 for the term will not see them. That is the same
 * bargain the trigram arm already makes at 50, and it only bites when a term
