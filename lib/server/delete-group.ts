/**
 * Group Deletion
 *
 * Deleting a group is the one irreversible thing an admin can do, and it
 * destroys other people's writing. Every choice below follows from that.
 *
 * **It shows you the damage first.** `getGroupDeletionSummary` exists so the
 * confirmation screen can say "this deletes 46 posts by 12 panas and cancels
 * 2 upcoming events" instead of "are you sure?". The counts are the whole
 * point: the person clicking is usually not the person who loses the most.
 *
 * **Member posts go with the group.** `social_statuses.group_id` cascades, and
 * we keep it that way. A post written into a group is addressed to that group;
 * orphaning it would leave posts visible to an audience that no longer exists,
 * with no page to read them on.
 *
 * **Events are deleted, not reassigned.** `events.host_group_id` is
 * ON DELETE RESTRICT, so the group cannot be removed while it hosts anything
 * -- deleting the events first is what clears the way, which is why no
 * migration is needed here. Reassigning was considered and rejected: the
 * `events_single_host` CHECK means a cancelled event still needs exactly one
 * host, and there is no honest candidate. Handing them to the deleting admin
 * makes them personally responsible for gatherings they just dissolved.
 *
 * **The handle stays retired.** We write a `screenname_history` row keyed by
 * the group's actor id, for the same reason account deletion keeps one: remote
 * servers and old links cached that identity, and letting someone else pick it
 * up turns every stale reference into an impersonation.
 *
 * Mirrors lib/server/delete-account.ts, which is the established shape for
 * this kind of teardown.
