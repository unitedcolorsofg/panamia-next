/**
 * The other Pana sites, as the masthead account menu lists them.
 *
 * Deliberately not `SHARED_ROOMS` (lib/panaverse/branding.ts): that list
 * answers "what else is on the main site" for the surface switcher, and is
 * scoped to rooms that are real and shipped. This one answers a different
 * question — "where else can I go in the Pana world" — so it leads with the
 * named offerings a member would recognise from a flyer, and is allowed to
 * name ones that are not built yet.
 *
 * A site with `href: null` is announced rather than linked. Naming an
 * unbuilt offering is a promise, so it renders as a dimmed, unclickable row
 * with a "coming soon" badge: nothing here is ever a link to a 404.
 *
 * Paths are stored relative, and resolved against the host being served by
 * `resolvePanaSites` — a server call, because `originForFrom` reads
 * PANAVERSE_ROOT_DOMAIN, which is a Worker var and not a NEXT_PUBLIC_ one. In
 * a client bundle that var is simply absent and the helper would silently fall
 * back to the compiled-in default, which is a class of bug that only appears
 * in the environment you cannot test locally. So the env read stays where the
 * env exists, and the answer travels down as data.
 *
 * A site on the surface already being served keeps its relative path and
 * navigates on the client. One belonging to another surface is made absolute,
 * because crossing surfaces really does mean crossing origins now that each
 * has a hostname of its own. Before PANAVERSE_SUBDOMAINS was turned on these
 * were relative unconditionally, which was right then and became a trap the
 * moment the flag flipped: a member on social.pana.social following `/d` got
 * the directory without ever leaving the social hostname.
