   * make the family read.
   *
   * Two-tier capitals: the house marks are not mixed case, they are capitals
   * throughout with only the lead letter of each word drawn large. PanaSocial
   * is P + ANA, S + OCIAL; PanaMiaClub does it three times. An all-caps or a
   * true-lowercase setting both miss this, and both were tried first.
   *
   * Set solid with no word space. Pana-flame sampled off the Pana Mia mark
   * rather than guessed. And a star inside the word — there is no `i` in
   * CONNECTORS for it to dot, so it stands in for the first `O`.
   *
   * Every glyph also carries a small seeded rotation, baseline shift and
   * weight change, because a uniform baseline is most of what makes type read
   * as type instead of as lettering. What it still cannot fake is the
   * irregular marker stroke of the real marks; that needs a person with a pen.

   * `.panaverse-logo` sizes marks by height with `width: auto` — a tighter

   * the word has no `i` at all. This one does not, so the proportions are
   * measured straight off the Pana Mia lockup: star radius about 0.30 of the
   * stem height, with a gap of roughly a tenth of the stem between them.
   *
   * Taller than its siblings (179 rather than ~130 at 800 wide) because the
   * canvas has to clear the star, and ADMIN is a short word so there are fewer
   * glyphs to spread that height across. `.panaverse-logo` sizes by height
