/**

 * renders the main site's directory, and until now it rendered it with no
 * header, no footer and no link home: the root layout withheld main-site chrome
 * on surface hostnames, and Pana Social had none of its own to put there. A
 * member who followed a directory link out of the feed simply arrived nowhere.
 *
 * Redirecting to the main site would also have closed the hole, and is the
 * cheaper fix, but it answers a member asking to see the directory by moving
 * them to a different hostname — which is precisely the "these are two separate
 * products" message the panaverse switcher exists to dispel. So the surface
 * keeps the member and frames the borrowed page instead.
 *
 * Three exclusions, each for a different reason:
 *   - The main site already has chrome of its own; this is only for surfaces
 *     that would otherwise render bare.
 *   - Doorways (`wearsOwnChrome`) frame themselves on every surface by design.
 *   - The surface's own routes are its home turf, not a borrowed room.
 *
 * An unknown path returns false rather than true. The pathname is absent only
 * when the request did not come through the Worker, and in that case leaving
 * the page exactly as it renders today is the safer failure.

 * site's bar under the status bar with nothing compensating — a layout bug with

 * the host, so the feed installs as Pana Social and then opens as Pana Mia.

/**
 * Which app an install started from this request would create.
 *
 * Three rules, narrowing:
 *
 *   - The host decides whenever it names a surface. social.pana.social owns its
 *     origin outright, so every page on it installs as Pana Social.
 *   - Otherwise the path decides. While PANAVERSE_SUBDOMAINS is off — the
 *     configuration we actually ship — Pana Social lives at pana.social/s,
 *     where the host resolves to the default surface, so keying the install off
 *     the host alone hands a member installing from the feed a tile labelled
 *     Pana Mia that opens the directory.
 *   - Otherwise, on a doorway only, the callback decides.
 *
 * The third rule exists because the first two describe the page you are on, and
 * a doorway is by definition a page you did not ask for. `/s` returns 200 and
 * emits the social manifest, but a signed-out member never sees it: the bounce
 * to `/signin` happens on the client, after that HTML has already landed. So
 * the page they actually install from is the doorway, `/signin` is not a social
 * route, and they get Pana Mia with a start_url of `/` — a directory app under
 * the name of one they never installed. The masthead's join link points at
 * `/signin?callbackUrl=%2Fs`, which makes that the ordinary way to reach social
 * while signed out, not an edge case.
 *
 * Restricted to doorways rather than read wherever it appears: `callbackUrl` on
 * an ordinary page is a link that page happens to contain, and has no bearing
 * on what that page is. On a doorway it is the only record of where the member
 * was going, which is the one question an install needs answered.
 *
 * An unknown path falls back to the surface the host named, for the same reason
 * the chrome predicates do: the pathname is absent only when the request did
 * not come through the Worker, and today's answer is the safer failure.
