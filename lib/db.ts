/**
 * Drizzle Database Client
 *
 * runWithDb(env, fn) must wrap request handling in the Cloudflare Worker entry
 * point (worker/index.ts). It creates a client for that request and scopes it
 * with AsyncLocalStorage, so the `db` proxy resolves to the current request's
 * client. A shared module-level client is unsafe: concurrent requests in one
 * isolate would use each other's sockets, which workerd rejects as
 * cross-request I/O and then cancels the request as hung.
 *
 * In production a fresh postgres.js client is created per request — Hyperdrive
 * manages the actual Supabase connection pool, so a new local socket to
 * Hyperdrive is cheap and avoids stale-connection failures.
 *
 * - Production (CF Workers): env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString via Hyperdrive, max: 5
 * - Local dev (vinext dev): env.POSTGRES_URL secret binding (from .dev.vars)
 * - Local dev (plain Node.js): process.env.POSTGRES_URL, cached
 *
 * Priority: env.POSTGRES_URL > HYPERDRIVE > process.env.POSTGRES_URL
 *
 * We check env.POSTGRES_URL BEFORE HYPERDRIVE because in local dev miniflare rewrites
 * env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString to use 127.0.0.1:<proxy_port> (not 'localhost'), so
 * a simple 'includes localhost' guard can't reliably detect the placeholder Hyperdrive.
 * In production env.POSTGRES_URL is never set, so Hyperdrive is always used there.

  // max: 1 — deliberately NOT the 5 the production path uses, and the
  //   difference is not a pooling preference. Dev talks to a local Postgres
  //   through postgres.js's Cloudflare build, whose socket polyfill
  //   mis-pipelines the extended query protocol once more than one query is in
  //   flight: a Bind lands against another query's Parse and the server
  //   rejects it with "bind message supplies N parameters, but prepared
  //   statement \"\" requires N-1" (SQLSTATE 08P01). `prepare: false` does not
  //   avoid it; serialising onto one connection does.
  //
  //   This was raised to 5 to make `Promise.all` behave in dev the way it does
  //   deployed. It does the opposite. Deployed, the concurrency is absorbed by
  //   Hyperdrive, which multiplexes properly; here it just crashes, and only
  //   on pages that fan out — so the events discovery feed and the host page
  //   both 500'd for signed-in readers while their signed-out versions, which
  //   skip the viewer-shaped queries, rendered fine.

    // leads to stale-connection failures once Hyperdrive silently closes an idle socket.
    //
    // max: 5 — Cloudflare's published value for postgres.js behind Hyperdrive,
    //   and the reason is a hard limit rather than a preference: a Worker
    //   invocation may have at most six outbound connections waiting on
    //   response headers, and a TCP socket counts. Five leaves one slot for
    //   any other fetch in the same request.
    //   https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/connect-to-postgres/postgres-drivers-and-libraries/postgres-js/
    //
    //   This was 1, on the reasoning that "Workers have no persistent
    //   connection pool". That is the reason the client is built per request
    //   (below); it is not a reason to cap that client at a single socket, and
    //   capping it had a cost that was easy to miss: postgres.js queues
    //   concurrent queries onto the available connections, so at max: 1 every
    //   `await Promise.all([...])` in this codebase ran sequentially. The
    //   search typeahead fires four such queries per keystroke batch.
    //
    //   Raising this does not multiply connections against Supabase. Hyperdrive
    //   pools to the origin independently and multiplexes in transaction mode;
    //   the origin ceiling is Hyperdrive's, not this number.
    //   https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/connection-pooling/
    //
    //   Do not raise it to 6. The docs say a seventh connection queues, but
    //   porsager/postgres#1023 — filed by a Cloudflare engineer — reports a
    //   production deadlock at max: 10 rather than graceful queueing, and that
    //   issue is what prompted the documented 5.
    //
    // prepare: false — Hyperdrive only supports the simple query protocol,
    //   not the extended protocol (prepared statements) that postgres.js uses by default.
    //   https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/examples/postgres-js/
    //
    //   That is no longer true: Hyperdrive now documents support for named
    //   prepared statements in postgres.js, and says leaving this false costs
    //   both its statement cache and an extra round trip per query. Left false
    //   here on purpose anyway — porsager/postgres#960 ("prepared statement
    //   already exists" against Hyperdrive) is still open, and `prepare: false`
    //   is the workaround in that thread. Worth revisiting as its own change,
    //   with somewhere to verify it; it is not a free flip.
    //
    // debug — log every query so failures are visible in wrangler tail.
    //   Opt-in rather than always-on. Workers Logs bills per event beyond the
    //   included allowance, and this emitted one event per query on every
    //   request — comfortably the largest single source of log volume in the
    //   Worker, for output nobody reads outside an active investigation.
    //   Set the DEBUG_REQUEST_LOG=1 secret to turn it back on; it gates the
    //   matching per-request breadcrumb in auth.ts too.
    //
    //   Failures are unaffected: errors still surface through the
    //   `observability` block in wrangler.jsonc, which samples at 100%. This
    //   only drops the successful-query chatter around them.
