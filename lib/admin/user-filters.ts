/**
 * The filter vocabulary for the accounts list, with no dependencies.
 *
 * Pure for the same reason `user-locks.ts` is: these guards are needed by the
 * page, by the test suite and potentially by a client control, and the module
 * that runs the queries imports `db`. Anything importing the guards from
 * there drags a database connection along with them.
 *
 * The guards exist at all because both values arrive from the query string,
 * where anyone can type anything. `listUsers` passes the account type into a
 * comparison, so an unrecognised value must be rejected here rather than
 * carried further in.
