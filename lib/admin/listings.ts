/**
 * The directory listing review queue, as data.
 *
 * Pure. Everything here takes a plain object and returns a plain value, so the
 * flag rules and the stats can be tested without a database and the route can
 * stay thin. The database half lives in `app/api/admin/listings/route.ts`.
 *
 * ## What a pending listing actually contains
 *
 * Less than the mock this screen was designed against assumed. `/form/get-listed`
 * writes no `categories` and no `counties` — those columns stay NULL on every
 * intake row — so the queue cannot show category or county chips without
 * inventing them. What intake *does* capture is `descriptions.tags` (category
 * labels as text), `addressLocality`/`addressRegion`, and `status.locallyBased`,
 * and those are what the queue renders instead. See `app/api/listings/intake`.
 */

/**
 * The reasons a listing gets held up, as things the application can be checked
 * against rather than opinions about the business.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately missing
 *
 * The design called for a "looks like a chain" flag. There is nothing in an
 * intake row that can decide that — it would have to be a keyword list against
 * the business name, which would be wrong often, and wrong in a specific
 * direction: it would tell a reviewer that a legitimate independent pana looks
 * like a franchise. A flag a reviewer learns to ignore is worse than no flag,
 * and one that quietly biases them against a real applicant is worse again.
 *
 * Every flag below is a fact about the submission, and every one of them has a
 * legitimate explanation. They say "read this one properly", never "decline".
