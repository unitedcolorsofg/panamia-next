/**
 * What the admin surface contains.
 *
 * Kept as data rather than as markup so the sidebar, the overview and anything
 * else that wants to enumerate staff tools read from one list. Adding a view
 * should be an entry here plus a route.
 *
 * ## Why there are icons and colours in here
 *
 * Six tools rendered as six lines of text are six identical shapes, and staff
 * who use this daily navigate by shape long before they read. The icon and the
 * group colour are the shape. They live beside the name because they are part
 * of what a view *is*, not decoration a component adds later — and because the
 * sidebar and the overview both need them and must not disagree.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not in here
 *
 * Mentoring, Articles and Podcasts were dropped from the sidebar so the
 * surface carries only the work being prioritised now. Their routes and their
 * endpoints are untouched and still answer — see `PARKED_TOOLS` at the bottom,
 * which keeps them written down rather than letting them become folklore.
