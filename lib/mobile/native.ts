/**
 * Is this page running inside the native shell?
 *
 * The shell loads the deployed site in a WebView rather than bundling it (see
 * capacitor.config.ts), so every module in `app/` and `components/` runs in
 * both places. This is the single source of truth for telling them apart.
 *
 * Deliberately reads `window.Capacitor` directly instead of importing
 * `@capacitor/core`. The bridge is injected into the page by the native
 * runtime, so the global is the actual fact on the ground — the npm package is
 * a typed wrapper around it. Importing that wrapper here would pull Capacitor
 * into the main web bundle for every browser visitor, the overwhelming
 * majority of whom will never run the app, in order to answer a question that
 * is one property read. Modules that need real plugin APIs import them lazily
 * behind `isNativeApp()`; see components/mobile/NativeShell.tsx.
 *
 * This is also why the check is not "is the user agent a phone". A member
 * browsing pana.social in mobile Safari is on a phone and is not in the app:
 * they have browser chrome, a URL bar, and a back gesture the app has to
 * provide for itself. Sniffing the user agent would give both of them the same
 * treatment and get one of them wrong.
