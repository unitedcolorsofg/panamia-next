 * strip uses one section above — flame means a human is needed — so the two
 * loud states on this page read as one alarm rather than two vocabularies.
 *
 * The quiet state is not blank, though, and that is the difference from the
 * strip. "Nothing is waiting" is the whole of what an empty queue has to
 * say; "the sweep ran" invites the follow-up "and did it do anything?", so
 * the facts stay visible even when the verdict is fine. They are what makes
 * the page worth opening on a good day, which is what keeps it trusted on a
 * bad one.
 *
 * Colour is never the only carrier: every state leads with a sentence that
 * says what is happening. The fill is how you notice from across the room,
 * not how you find out.
