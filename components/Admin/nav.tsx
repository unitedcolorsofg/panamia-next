/**
 * The admin surface's navigation.
 *
 * Replaces the old `AdminMenu` strip, which was a wrapping row of black pills
 * that needed two rows at 1280px and four at 430px. A row that grows sideways
 * gets worse with every tool added; a column does not, which is the whole
 * reason this is a sidebar.
 *
 * Active state is an exact pathname match rather than a prefix match on
 * purpose: `/admin` is a prefix of every other route here, so prefix matching
 * would light up Overview on every page.
 *
 * ## The icons are not decoration
 *
 * Six links of similar length in one column are six identical shapes, and the
 * only way to tell them apart is to read all six. Each one now carries its
 * view's icon on a chip in its group's colour, so the column can be navigated
 * by position and colour the way a toolbar is — which is what someone who
 * opens this every day actually does.
 *
 * Below `lg` this is still a horizontal strip, because a sidebar on a phone is
 * either a drawer behind a tap or a column that pushes the work off-screen.
 * The strip is 63px tall against the old menu's 244px, and it scrolls rather
 * than wraps, so it stays one row however many tools get added.
