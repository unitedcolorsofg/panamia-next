/**
 * The messages button, beside the bell in the masthead.
 *
 * Chat shipped with its only entry point inside the notifications panel — a
 * row under the bell, two clicks from anywhere. That is the wrong depth for
 * it: notifications are things that happened to you and are read once, while
 * messages are a place you go back to, and burying a destination inside a
 * transient popup makes it findable only by someone who already knows it is
 * there. The first thing asked of the shipped feature was "where do I send
 * messages?", which is the question a missing button produces.
 *
 * A link rather than a menu, because there is nothing to preview here that
 * /messages does not do better — and because the one control that opens a
 * frame in this corner should stay the bell.
 *
 * Gates itself on the session, for the same reason `NotificationsMenu` does:
 * one of the two mastheads that mount it renders on the server and cannot
 * check. Signed-out visitors have no threads, and /messages would bounce them.
