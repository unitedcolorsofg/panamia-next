 * away from the product's own masthead without the masthead moving too.
 *
 * Only Pana Social is here today — it is the one offering with a surface of

/**
 * The front page every offering gets, told in the homepage's own language.
 *
 * The homepage answers "what is this place?" in bands — a first screen, the
 * basics, the pillars, then the ask. An offering's front page is the same
 * shape one level down. It reuses the homepage's type (`.hero-headline`,
 * `.section-display`, `.section-lede`), its closing band (`.story-point`) and
 * its palette rather than restating any of them, so the six pages cannot drift
 * away from the page they hang off.
 *
 * What it deliberately does *not* borrow is the first screen. The street scene
 * and the search card are the homepage's own argument — the physical place,
 * and the one box that opens it — and repeating them six times would make each
 * offering look like another copy of the front door rather than a room behind
 * it. These open on the headline instead.
 *
 * ## Why the middle of the page is optional
 *
 * The first version of this rendered one fixed shape six times: headline,
 * three cards titled "What You Get", closing band. Every page therefore made
 * the same argument in the same order, which is a brochure — it lists what a
 * thing has without ever saying what is wrong today or how the thing works.
 *
 * The homepage does not do that. Its pillars run problem → answer → programs
 * and its beats run question → answer → detail. So two optional bands are
 * available here in the same spirit:
 *
 * - `problem`  — the tension. What is broken if this offering does not exist.
 * - `pillars`  — the definition. The two or three things the offering *is*.
 * - `steps`    — the mechanism. How the thing actually works, in order.
 * - `tour`     — the rooms. The screens themselves, one per band, shown.
 *
 * `problem` and `pillars` are alternative openings rather than a pair, and an
 * offering normally defines one of them. Leading with the tension suits a
 * thing whose value only lands once you have felt what is missing; leading
 * with the pillars suits one whose value is the headline itself, where
 * arguing the problem first would delay the answer the reader came for.
 *
 * `steps` and `tour` are likewise alternatives, and for a related reason. A
 * numbered walkthrough is the right shape for an offering you have to be
 * talked through — the order is the explanation. A tour is the right shape
 * for one that is already built and can simply be shown, where the honest
 * answer to "how does it work" is a picture of it working.
 *
 * All three render only when the offering's locale file defines them, which is
 * what lets these pages be written one at a time instead of needing all six
 * rewritten at once. An offering with none falls back to exactly the shape it
 * had before.
 *
 * The shapes are deliberately different from each other — a statement with
 * symptoms, or a statement with named pillars, then a stacked walkthrough,
 * then a row of cards — because three three-across grids in a column is the
 * other way to be monotonous.

 * ## Adding a screenshot
 *
 * 1. Drop the file in `public/img/social/` — `feed.webp`, `groups.webp`,
 *    `events.webp`, `profiles.webp`, `stories.webp`.
 * 2. Add its entry below. `width` and `height` are the file's real pixel
 *    dimensions, which `next/image` needs in order to reserve the space
 *    before the file has loaded.
 *
 *    social: { feed: { src: '/img/social/feed.webp', width: 1600, height: 1000 } }
 *
 * Shots are cropped to a 16:10 well from the top, so capture the window at
 * roughly that shape and let the fold do the rest — the top of a screen is
 * the part worth showing anyway.
 *
 * A room with no entry renders an empty frame carrying its own name. That is
 * deliberately a visible gap rather than a drawn mock-up of the product:
 * these pages are read by people deciding whether to trust the thing, and an
 * illustration dressed as a screenshot is a promise about software that may
 * not look like that yet.
 *
 * ## Where the four present shots came from
 *
 * All four are captures of this repo's own design mocks, taken at 1600x1000
 * with the surrounding site header, footer and `.mock-toolbar` removed, so
 * the frame holds the product and nothing else:
 *
 * - `feed` — `/mock/feed`.
 * - `groups` and `events` — `/mock/group`, whose Posts and Events tabs are
 *   two views of one surface. Events is shot there rather than at `/e`
 *   because the point of the room is that an event belongs to the people
 *   already gathered, and the group page is where that is visible.
 * - `profiles` — `/mock/profile-next`, not `/mock/profile`. The `-next` mock
 *   is the identity-rail layout that shipped to `/p/[user]`; the older one is
 *   kept beside it for comparison and no longer matches the product.
 *
 * That last distinction is the trap worth flagging: both mocks render the
 * same fixtures, so a stale capture looks perfectly plausible. Check which
 * layout `app/p/[user]/_components/personal/` actually renders before
 * reshooting.
 *
 * ## Why stories has no shot
 *
 * Not because it is unbuilt — it is. `components/social/StoryRing.tsx` and
 * `app/s/_components/stories-rail.tsx` are live, backed by a batched summary
 * endpoint and a nightly expiry purge, and the ring is already visible on the
 * avatar in `profiles.webp`.
 *
 * It has no shot because it cannot honestly be photographed from a local
 * checkout. `StoriesRail` returns `null` without a signed-in actor, and even
 * with one it draws only the panas that viewer follows who have something
 * live in the last 24 hours — so the strip needs a real session, real
 * follows and unexpired stories all at once. No mock stands in for it.
 * Capture it from a seeded environment and add it.

 * claim the homepage makes in exactly that card, so it should be the same
 * object rather than a lookalike that drifts the first time one of them is
 * touched.

 * Two pieces of the homepage row are deliberately left behind. `.beat-art` is
 * the shop window, and there is no artwork here to put in it. `.beat-copy`

/**
 * The rooms of the product, shown instead of described.
 *
 * The band this replaces on Pana Social was a numbered walkthrough — claim a
 * handle, follow some panas, reach the fediverse. All true, and all invisible:
 * three paragraphs asking somebody to imagine software they have never seen.
 * Pana Social is built, so the honest answer to "how does it work" is a
 * picture of it working.
 *
 * Each room therefore gets a screenshot and a claim, and the claim is always
 * the same kind of claim: not what the screen contains, but which people it
 * puts back in front of you. A feed is a feed anywhere — the argument here is
 * that this one is full of panas within driving distance. That theme is why
 * the rooms are worth five bands rather than five bullet points, and it is
 * what each `title` in the locale file is written to carry.
 *
 * ## Why the rows alternate
 *
 * Five identical rows is a spreadsheet. Flipping the image side on every
 * other row gives the band a rhythm to read down and keeps the eye moving
 * between picture and words, which is also roughly how long a reader spends
 * on each. The flip is a CSS `:nth-child` concern rather than anything the
 * markup knows about, so the DOM order stays image-then-copy for everybody
 * reading it linearly, including screen readers.
 *
 * The frame is the mock browser window from `/mock/panaverse`, reused down to
 * the class names. A screenshot needs a window around it or it reads as a
 * rectangle someone pasted onto the page, and drawing a second window that
 * merely resembles the first is how two windows end up disagreeing.
