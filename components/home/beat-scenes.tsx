 * single frame of a real room also says "these are panas" faster than an
 * arrangement of smaller ones does, because there is nothing to read first.
 *
 * `fill` rather than intrinsic dimensions: the card is a fixed-height window
 * whose width changes with the column, so there is no aspect ratio to hold
 * and the crop has to follow the box. The wrapper is what rounds and clips
 * it - `border-radius` on the image alone leaves square corners behind
 * whenever the browser paints the background of the replaced element.

 * that point before the paragraph next to it does.
 *

 * have read as a picture inside a picture, so the wrapper keeps nothing but
 * `overflow: hidden` - which is still load-bearing, because it is what the
