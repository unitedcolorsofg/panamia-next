/**
 * The three pillars, as expanding panels.
 *
 * The deck puts Collective Tech, Community Building and Culture Work on one
 * slide as three equal columns, and that is the claim: they are three halves
 * of the same thing, not a ranked list. Three equal columns of body copy on a
 * homepage is also how you get three columns nobody reads — so the panels keep
 * all three present at once and give the open one the room its programme list
 * needs.
 *
 * Above 64rem the closed panels collapse to a spine and the open one takes the
 * remaining width, which is the shape in the sketch.
 *
 * Below that it is a horizontal rail of three whole cards, matching the
 * questions above it. It was a vertical accordion, which cost the section its
 * one-screen promise: an open panel plus two closed bars plus the heading ran
 * 1,117px against an 844px phone, so the section could not be taken in at a
 * glance no matter how much padding came out of it. As a rail only one pillar
 * is on screen, so each one gets the full height instead of a third of it,
 * and nothing has to be cut to make the three fit together.
 *
 * On a rail there is no disclosure left — every card is already open — so the
 * trigger stops being a button rather than sitting there claiming an
 * `aria-expanded` it no longer controls.
 *
 * One panel is always open, so the section never collapses into three closed
 * bars with nothing to read. That means clicking the open panel is a no-op
 * rather than a close — the honest alternative, letting it close, leaves a
 * state where the section says nothing at all.
