/**
 * The web app's half of the native shell.
 *
 * The shell is a WebView pointed at this deploy (see capacitor.config.ts), so
 * the site is doing its own rendering exactly as it does in a browser. What it
 * is not doing by default is any of the things a browser normally handles on
 * its behalf: dismissing the launch screen, answering the Android back button,
 * and turning a tapped link to pana.social into in-app navigation rather than
 * a page the member never arrives at. This component is where those are wired.
 *
 * Renders nothing. It is mounted for its effects, beside ScreennameGate in the
 * root layout, because every one of these concerns is app-wide — a back button
 * that only worked on the pages which remembered to opt in would be a back
 * button that appears broken at random.
 *
 * Every plugin is imported lazily, inside the native branch. That import is
 * the thing that would otherwise cost browser visitors: `isNativeApp()` is a
 * property read on a global the native runtime injects, so in a browser this
 * component does nothing and downloads nothing.

       * and produce the ignored-link behaviour this listener exists to fix.

       * listener should only ever be handed a URL the app has declared it
       * handles (see app/.well-known/ and the native claims described there),
