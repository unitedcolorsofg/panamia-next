/**
 * Prompts a signed-in user who has no screenname to claim one.
 *
 * A screenname is what creates the user's profile (see
 * app/api/user/screenname/set/route.ts), and the profile is what social
 * identity hangs off — social_actors references profiles, so an account
 * without one can browse but can never post, follow, or be followed.
 *
 * Before this, the only screenname prompt in the product was on the "new
 * article" page, so anyone who signed in to browse the directory or use Pana
 * Social silently never got a profile. Living in the root layout is what makes
 * this cover every route in, rather than just the sign-in page: magic links,
 * OAuth callbacks and already-existing accounts all land somewhere arbitrary.
 *
 * Two audiences arrive here and they are not the same person:
 *
 *   - An account minutes old has never been asked. It goes to /welcome, where
 *     the question gets a whole page, an explanation, and room to also collect
 *     a display name.
 *   - An account that has gone months without a screenname has been asked and
 *     declined. Yanking that person out of whatever they were reading would be
 *     a hijack, so they keep the modal they can dismiss.
 *
 * Deliberately skippable in both cases. Claiming a screenname is a
 * 90-day-cooldown decision (SCREENNAME_COOLDOWN_DAYS), so pressuring a
 * first-time visitor into one to get past a modal is worse than asking again
 * later. Dismissal is remembered for the browser session so it asks once, not
 * on every navigation.
