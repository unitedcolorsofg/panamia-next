/**
 * The closing rule under a surface's own rooms.
 *
 * `SurfaceMemberHeader` alone would have left the gap this closes. A surface
 * renders neither MainFooter nor the guest footer over its own pages, so
 * social.pana.social/s and every public profile at /p/* had no route to the
 * terms or the privacy policy at all. The profiles are the part that makes it
 * a compliance gap rather than a missing flourish: they are public, indexable
 * pages that a signed-out visitor can reach, and on the social surface they
 * offered no legal links whatsoever.
 *
 * Deliberately not a site footer. `/signin` set the pattern — a page that
 * carries only the legal links a visitor needs rather than reproducing
 * MainFooter — and `SurfaceGuestFooter` followed it. This follows both.
 *
 * The links are relative, so they open on the surface the member is already in
 * and arrive wearing the guest treatment. Sending a member to Pana Mia to read
 * the terms would undo the decision the whole surface split implements.
 *
 * It carries no switcher and no way home: the surface masthead above it is
 * sticky, so both are on screen no matter how far down a timeline the member
 * has scrolled.
