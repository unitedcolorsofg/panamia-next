 * `originForFrom` reads PANAVERSE_ROOT_DOMAIN, which is a Worker var and not a
 * NEXT_PUBLIC_ one, so in a client bundle it is simply absent and the helper
 * would silently fall back to the compiled-in default. That is correct today
 * and would be wrong the moment the root domain is configured to anything
 * else — a class of bug that shows up only in the environment you cannot test

 * handed off to a different company's product.
 *
 * So it leads with identity rather than with a list of links. The first thing
 * in the panel is who you are and the handle that is the same in every room;
 * the destinations come after. An app-grid of equal tiles — the pattern this
 * could easily have been — says "here are our products". This says "here is
 * you, and here is where you can take yourself".
 *
 * The handle is the load-bearing element and is genuinely load-bearing rather
 * than decoratively so: it is minted against the federation domain, so it is
 * the same string on every surface and on every other fediverse server.
