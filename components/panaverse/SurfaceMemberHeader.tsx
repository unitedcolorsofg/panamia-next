/**
 * The masthead a surface wears over its own rooms.
 *
 * Pana Social had none. The root layout withholds the Pana Mia masthead on
 * surface hostnames — correctly, because that masthead over a timeline is what
 * made Pana Social read as a section of the main site — and `SurfaceGuestHeader`
 * only covers pages a surface has *borrowed*. The surface's own front door fell
 * between the two, so a signed-in member at social.pana.social/s got a bare
 * page: no mark, no nav, no account, and no route back to Pana Mia.
 *
 * Mark on the left, search in the middle, account on the right: the shape a
 * timeline wears, rather than the main site's centred mark. The two surfaces
 * share an account and a palette, and diverge here because finding a Pana is
 * the first thing done on a social feed and never the first thing done on a
 * directory landing page.
 *
 * NAV IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT, but the route home is not. The MENU drawer that
 * used to sit on the left carried the surface nav, the shared rooms, and — via
 * `originForFrom` — the only link that could cross from social.pana.social
 * back to the main site. That last one now comes from `PANA_SITES` in the
 * account menu instead: its paths are resolved server-side by
 * `resolvePanaSites`, so a site on another surface links to that surface's
 * origin. Until PANAVERSE_SUBDOMAINS was turned on those links were relative
 * and a member could not leave this hostname through them; they can now.
 *
 * What is still missing is the surface nav proper — the rooms of Pana Social
 * itself. See `SurfaceMenu` in the history of this directory for what was here.
 *
 * Rendered server-side. Only the controls that need session state are client
 * components.
