/**
 * The bar a surface wears over a page it is borrowing from another surface.
 *
 * One deploy serves the whole panaverse, so every route answers on every
 * hostname: social.pana.social/directory/search really does render the main
 * site's directory. That is a feature — a member who wants the directory
 * should not be bounced to a different hostname to read it — but until this
 * existed those pages rendered with no header, no footer and no way back to
 * the feed. The surface kept the member and then stranded them.
 *
 * So this is deliberately not a second masthead. It carries the two things a
 * borrowed page cannot supply for itself:
 *
 *   - the mark, linking home, so the member can always get back to the surface
 *     they were actually in;
 *   - an honest statement of whose page this is, with a link to it on its own
 *     surface, for anyone who wants the full site around it.
 *
 * It has no nav. A directory nav rendered under the Pana Social mark would
 * claim the surface owns pages it is only showing, which is the same
 * confusion in the opposite direction.
