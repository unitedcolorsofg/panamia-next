/**
 * The search field a surface carries in the middle of its masthead.
 *
 * It was a plain GET form, so that it worked before the bundle landed and on a
 * page with JavaScript off. It is now the club-wide typeahead, which keeps
 * that: `DirectorySuggest` renders a real GET with a real `name="q"` and only
 * preventDefaults once hydrated, so the no-JS path is the same document
 * navigation it always was. That is also why it still sidesteps the
 * stale-chrome problem `SurfaceLink` exists for — submitting reaches the
 * server, which picks the chrome again on the way in.
 *
 * THE FIELD USED TO COMMIT TO ONE SCOPE, and that reasoning is worth keeping
 * because part of it still holds. The field once pointed at Pana Social's own
 * `/search`, which covered Panas and groups; it then briefly pointed at the
 * directory's Everything scope, which covered all four kinds. Everything is
 * gone — the search box searches exactly one kind, named by the control next
 * to it — and the argument was that a 2.125rem bar had no room for that
 * control.
 *
 * That turned out to be true of the trigger rather than of the bar. `ScopeMenu`
 * now has a `compact` variant that fits, so the field offers the choice its
 * placeholder was already narrowing for, and a member reaches all four kinds
 * from the surface instead of being sent to the homepage for three of them.
 *
 * THE SIGN-IN-WALL HAZARD IS REAL, AND IS NOT ANSWERED BY WHO SEES THIS FIELD.
 * The note here used to say that a masthead "sits in chrome that does not know
 * who is looking", and concluded that a gated scope would answer an anonymous
 * visitor with a wall. The first half is exactly right: `wearsSurfaceChrome`
 * takes a surface and a pathname and never a session, so this renders for
 * signed-out visitors too, on every public room the surface owns. `/groups` is
 * the plain case — documented public either way — and a guest there gets this
 * masthead. `SurfaceMemberHeader` is named for the surface's own rooms, not
 * for who is reading them.
 *
 * What answers the hazard is the menu, not the audience. `ScopeMenuLive` reads
 * the session itself and hands `signedIn` to `ScopeMenu`, which draws the
 * members-only row locked and skips it with the arrow keys. Panas is the only
 * gated scope; the directory, events and groups are public. So a signed-out
 * visitor is never offered a door that will not open, and the homepage has
 * shown this same menu to guests on the same terms since it shipped.
 *
 * GROUPS REMAINS THE DEFAULT, for the reasons that never depended on any of
 * the above: it is the social surface's native kind, it is the half that is
 * public, and it is what everyone's muscle memory already expects from this
 * field. The menu changes what a member can ask for; it does not change where
 * a bare submit lands. That also keeps the no-JS path honest — unhydrated, the
 * form's action is still `scopePath('group', '')`, so submitting with
 * scripting off degrades to groups rather than to a dead form.
 *
 * Client rather than server, which it was: the chosen scope is state, and it
 * has to narrow the placeholder and retarget the form between renders.

     satisfies label-in-name, so someone saying "search events" hits the thing
     the screen says "Search events".
