/**
 * The Pana Connectors front door.
 *
 * Lives here rather than in `app/connectors/page.tsx` because two routes need
 * it: that path, and `/` when the request arrives on `connectors.pana.social`.
 * The subdomain's root has to render the same thing its named path does, and
 * the only alternative to sharing a component is keeping two copies of a
 * redirect in step forever.
 *
 * Two audiences arrive at the same door and only one of them wants a pitch.
 * Someone who is already a connector clicked the bubble to get to their
 * commitments, so they are sent straight through to the HQ; everybody else
 * gets the explanation of what the programme is.
 *
 * Only an *accepted* member is redirected. Somebody still waiting on a
 * decision, or who was turned down, keeps the pitch — bouncing them would mean
 * a declined applicant could never read the page again without being shown
 * their rejection, and a pending one would lose the explanation of the thing
 * they are waiting to be let into.
 *
 * ## Why this is dynamic
 *
 * It reads the session, so it cannot be cached at the edge the way the other
 * offering front pages are. That is the cost of the redirect above, and it is
 * the same cost the mock version paid for reading `?as=` — which this
 * replaces. A connector who has to scroll past the recruitment pitch every
 * time they open the bubble stops using the bubble.
