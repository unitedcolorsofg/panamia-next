/**
 * The connector intake.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * The front page's primary button said "Become a Connector" and pointed at
 * `/form/get-listed`, which is the public *business directory* intake — a
 * seven-step form asking for your shop's categories and socials. Someone who
 * read the whole programme pitch and decided they wanted in was handed a form
 * about their business, or about a business they do not have. That was the one
 * genuine hole in the surface: the pitch had no door at the end of it.
 *
 * ## Why these three questions
 *
 * The offering page already tells readers how it works: "Pick a house, join a
 * pod, start at the first tier." This form is that sentence, in order, and
 * nothing else. Every field a reviewer might reach for — how long have you
 * been organizing, what are your qualifications, how many hours a week — is
 * absent on purpose, because the programme is emphatic that the tiers do not
 * rank anybody and that everyone starts at Tier 1. A form that opens by
 * scoring people contradicts the programme on the way in.
 *
 * That is still true with an approval step in front of it. Staff decide
 * whether somebody joins; this form does not try to help them by collecting
 * evidence, because the decision is a conversation about a person and not a
 * score computed from a textarea.
 *
 * Tier is shown and not asked, for the same reason. The API never reads a
 * tier off the request.
 *
 * Name and email are not asked either, because you have to be signed in to
 * reach this page and we already have both. Asking a signed-in member to type
 * their own name is how a form tells somebody it is not really connected to
 * anything.
 *
 * ## Submitting
 *
 * POSTs to `/api/connectors/join`, which writes a `pending` record on the
 * signed-in human's own profile and is idempotent — re-submitting edits the
 * application and carries over `appliedAt`, the staff decision and existing
 * commitments. That is what makes it safe to use this same form for "change
 * my houses" after being accepted.
