/**
 * Who has room to take something on.
 *
 * ## It is a bar chart of other people, not a gauge
 *
 * There is no capacity figure anywhere in this programme — `lib/connectors/
 * model.ts` quotes the deck saying the tiers "do not correspond to how
 * developed someone is" and that "everyone starts in Tier 1", and the join
 * form's "what I can bring" is free prose. So nothing here can be divided by
 * anything, and a "72% full" meter would be quoting a denominator somebody
 * made up.
 *
 * The bar is therefore scaled against the busiest person on the roster. That
 * is a real comparison and it answers the real question — not "is Ana at
 * capacity" but "of these people, who is carrying least" — and it re-scales
 * itself as the programme's workload changes rather than ageing into a
 * fiction.
 *
 * ## Unestimated work is shown, never zeroed
 *
 * Every commitment written before drizzle/0059 has no size. Folding those to
 * zero would make somebody carrying six unsized errands look completely free,
 * which is the exact error this table exists to prevent — the staffer would
 * hand them a seventh. So the unsized count rides alongside the total, and a
 * row whose work is entirely unsized says so instead of showing "0h".
 *
 * ## Sorted by who is freest, unless you say otherwise
 *
 * Ascending by default, because the page's job is finding somebody to assign
 * to. A table sorted busiest-first makes you read to the bottom for the
 * answer. People with nothing open sort first and are the point of the whole
 * page.
 *
 * Name is the alternative because the other real task here is looking one
 * person up — somebody asks what they are carrying, or you are checking
 * whether you already gave them something this week. Under the load sort
 * their position depends on everyone else's workload, so it moves between
 * visits and there is nowhere to aim. A–Z puts them where you expect.
 *
 * There is deliberately no busiest-first option. It would answer "who is
 * overloaded", which is a real question, but the chip already says
 * "Carrying the most" and a third button costs more than it returns.
 *
 * ## The list scrolls rather than growing
 *
 * The roster is open-ended, and this panel shares a row with the assign form
 * from `xl` up. Left unbounded, thirty connectors push the page metres past
 * the form it is meant to be read next to, which defeats putting them side by
 * side at all. So the rows scroll inside a fixed height and the legend stays
 * pinned underneath, where it is still legible while you scroll.
 *
 * The count sits above the list because a scroll container hides its own
 * size: without it there is no way to tell eight connectors from forty.
 *
 * ## Houses ride with the name
 *
 * They used to sit on a line of their own under the bar. Moved up beside the
 * name they cost no height at all, and they belong there: which houses
 * somebody is in is part of who they are, not a footnote to their workload.
 * It matters while choosing, too — a narrative task wants somebody in
 * Narrative Shifters, and the house list in the form is narrowed to whatever
 * the chips here already showed.
 *
 * Folding them up, and putting the button on the bar's line, took the row
 * from three lines to two. The same cap that showed five connectors now
 * shows nine.
 */

/**
 * The houses somebody is in, as chips beside their name.
 *
 * Carries each house's own colour because that colour is part of the
 * programme model, not decoration — a connector learns "I am indigo" from the
 * join form and the front page, and this is the same badge. The palette was
 * measured against 4.5:1 for small bold text in a pill, which is exactly this
 * use, so the fills are safe to apply directly.
 *
 * Written as inline custom properties rather than Tailwind classes:
 * `bg-${house.color}` produces a class that exists nowhere in the stylesheet,
 * because Tailwind only emits utilities it can read as whole strings at build
 * time. Every other house chip in the programme is drawn this way.
 *
 * A house the model no longer knows renders as its raw id in a neutral chip.
 * That is a membership somebody really has, and dropping it silently would
 * misreport who is in what; showing the id says plainly that it needs fixing.
 *
 * No houses at all gets its own chip rather than blank space. A task cannot be
 * filed without a house, so an unplaced connector is not merely undecorated —
 * they cannot be given anything until it is sorted.
