/**
 * The queue of people waiting to be let into the Connectors programme.
 *
 * This is the other half of the gate in `app/api/connectors/join/route.ts`.
 * Applying writes a `pending` record; nothing turns it into membership except
 * somebody clicking Accept here.
 *
 * ## Why this is real when the rest of the page is not
 *
 * The dashboard below it still renders fixtures and says so. This panel reads
 * live rows and writes real decisions, which is why it sits above the mock
 * bar rather than under it — a staff member needs to know which of the things
 * on this screen actually does something, and "everything below is a fixture"
 * would be a lie told over a working Accept button.
 *
 * ## Why the row disappears on success
 *
 * Decided applications are not shown. Keeping them with a greyed-out label
 * would turn a queue you work to empty into a list that only grows, and the
 * record of who decided what is on the profile — `decidedBy` and `decidedAt`
 * — rather than in this panel's memory.
 *
 * The row is removed locally *and* `router.refresh()` is called: the local
 * removal is so the button does not sit there looking unclicked while the
 * server round-trips, and the refresh is because the pod and house tallies
 * elsewhere on the page are now wrong.

 * The catch is that a `'use client'` component still renders once on the

 * gets the Worker's — UTC — so a late-evening application renders as one date
 * on the server and the next date in Miami, the two passes disagree, and

 * shows up once somebody has actually applied, which is the worst time to

 * So the first pass is pinned: the programme's own timezone and a fixed
 * locale, identical on both sides. Once the component is really in the
 * reader's browser it re-renders in the reader's own settings, which is what
