/**
 * The action library — "what should I actually do?", answered.
 *
 * ## The gap this closes
 *
 * The programme deck devotes four slides to this question: each house gets a
 * list of real actions at each of the three tiers, thirty-six in total. In
 * the app those lists were rendered as a read-only ladder in the sidebar, and
 * the only way to act on one was to read it, remember it, and retype it into
 * a free-text box further up the page.
 *
 * So the hardest question in the programme — a new Tier 1 connector asking
 * what they are supposed to do on Monday — was answered by an empty input.
 * Every action here is one click away from being a commitment now.
 *
 * The deck also keeps a growing list of actions in a public spreadsheet that
 * connectors are invited to add to. This is not that list; this is the
 * canonical set from the deck, which is the part that already lives in the
 * codebase as data. The spreadsheet is the obvious next thing to absorb, and
 * when it is, it lands in `lib/connectors/model.ts` beside these.
 *
 * ## Why all three tiers are shown, not just yours
 *
 * The deck is emphatic that tiers are not a ranking and not a measure of how
 * far along anybody is — everyone starts at Tier 1 regardless of how much
 * organising they have done. They describe how much weight you are carrying.
 *
 * Showing only your own tier would quietly turn that into a gate. Showing all
 * three, with yours marked and every action committable, keeps it a
 * description of the work rather than a permission level: if a Tier 1
 * connector wants to run a workshop, nothing here stops them.
 *
 * ## Why other houses are behind a toggle
 *
 * Your own houses are the answer nine times out of ten, and thirty-six
 * actions at once is a wall rather than a prompt. But the programme does not
 * fence houses off — the commitment form has always let you file work under a
 * house you are not in — so the rest stay one click away rather than absent.
